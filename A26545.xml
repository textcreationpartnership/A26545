            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:66021:3"/>had meant nothing elſe by this but to ſerenade his Miſtreſs; yet certainly, thoſe that have a more deep Judgment, and pious Conſideration, look upon it as the moſt <hi>exact piece</hi> of Poetry (next to the <hi>Biblia bibliorum,</hi> as the <hi>Pſalms</hi> are particularly called) that ever came forth into the World, and it's being received as Canonical for ſo many Hundred of years, commented on by ſo many Worthy and Famous Men, the ſeveral Parts and Members being ſo often treated on in Pulpits, muſt needs be a great Argument that the <hi>Subject</hi> was ſomething more than ordinary. Had it been nothing elſe but a <hi>wanton Poem,</hi> Poſterity would never have ſo much admired it, learned and curious Judgments never have Compoſed ſo many <hi>Paraphraſes</hi> upon it. A Song of <hi>Love</hi> indeed it is, but of ſo great, ſo good, ſo glorious a Love, as is reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal,
<pb facs="tcp:66021:3"/>between Chriſt, and his Spouſe the Church; <hi>wonderful,</hi> and <hi>paſſing the Love of Women.</hi> But I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, the <hi>intricacy</hi> and <hi>difficulty</hi> of underſtanding it, has been no ſmall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why ſome perſons, either out of <hi>lazineſs,</hi> or <hi>impiety,</hi> have ſo much diſreſpected it; yet leſt the Poyſon ſhould ſpread it ſelf any farther, in theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Sheets is laid down a ſufficient diſcovery of the whole Myſtery; every <hi>Verſe,</hi> nay, almoſt every <hi>Word,</hi> being diſſected and laid open in all their Significations proper and figurative, and delineated ſo to the Life, that he that runs may read, in a ſtile as <hi>humble</hi> as the Author, as <hi>pious</hi> and <hi>paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> as the Subject of the Book, and with all poſſible Care and Induſtry that <hi>Human Learning,</hi> ſanctified by the eſpecial <hi>Grace</hi> of God, could ſhew or endeavour. And certainly, nothing can
<pb facs="tcp:66021:4"/>more need a <hi>Commentary,</hi> than that which is altogether a <hi>Parable,</hi> a form of ſpeaking that Chriſt himſelf ſo much delighted in, and ſometimes condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to interpret, and the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of it being ſo <hi>uſeful</hi> and <hi>comfortable</hi> to to Mankind. The <hi>Author</hi> of this enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Treatiſe, as his <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Piety,</hi> were very <hi>eminent,</hi> ſo his <hi>Modeſty</hi> was <hi>exemplary,</hi> in ſo much that in all his life time he could not be induced by the intreaty and importunity of his Friends to Publiſh it; yet leaſt ſo precious a Jewel ſhould lye in darkneſs, firſt, for the <hi>good</hi> of Souls and <hi>benefit</hi> of Human kind; and next, to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate the <hi>Memory</hi> of this <hi>good</hi> and <hi>pious</hi> Man; I have, with the advice of his Friends and Relations, thought fit to make known to the World the <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> of the Author by the <hi>ſufficiency</hi> of the Work.
<pb facs="tcp:66021:4"/>Not at all doubting (Chriſtian Reader) but that it will be acceptable to all pious and devout Spirits, eſpecially at this time when the Church of God is under Afflictions, and the Enemies thereof are continually undermining and diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the Peace of it. Yet (God be praiſed) though ſhe be <hi>Black,</hi> under Sorrows and Temptations, yet ſhe is <hi>Comely,</hi> and the <hi>Knot of Love</hi> between Chriſt and his Spouſe no mortal Hand will be able to untie; which is, and ought to be, a <hi>Comfort</hi> to all Chriſtians.

               <head>AN ENTRANCE Into the moſt Excellent <hi>SONG of SONGS,</hi> WHICH IS SOLOMONS.</head>
               <p>COncerning the time when <hi>SOLOMON</hi> wrote this Book, whether before his Fall, or after his Repentance, it skills not much to know, neither will any wiſe Man much contend about it, as being a thing tending to Strife and Debate, rather than to any godly Edifying in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth. And to ſpeak much for the Authority of it, ſeeing it hath been recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Church of God for ſo many Hundred years paſt, both before Chriſt's coming, and ſince, and kept (as it were) in the Ark and Sanctuary of God, with the reſt of the holy
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66021:6"/>Scripture, when all the reſt of his Songs were caſt aſide, may ſeem to be ridiculous; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that ſome in former times have endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to blemiſh it, counting it but a wanton Toy or Ballad about the geſtures of Lovers; it may not be amiſs to ſpeak a few words briefly, in Anſwer to their Objections.</p>
               <p>Firſt then let it be conſidered, that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter herein contained muſt either pertain to <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon:</hi> and ſome Queen of his; or elſe to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and his Queen. Not to <hi>Solomon;</hi> for the King that is here ſpoken of is ſet out as one keeping Sheep, as in <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. which was not a thing proper for <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Royalty. And alſo to be without, ſhut from his Wife, as in <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. until the Dew fell upon his head; which agreeth not to <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Princely State. For what Queen of his would offer him ſo much diſgrace?</p>
               <p>And for what is ſaid of the Bride in this Song, can never agree to any Queen of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s; for it is ſaid, that ſhe was without ſpot, and that her Bridegroom was gone, ſhe had loſt him, and that ſhe was fain to ſeek him up and down the City, and that ſhe was taken of the Watchmen and beaten: And who durſt do this to any Queen of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s? Therefore ſeeing it cannot agree to <hi>Solomon,</hi> nor to any Queen of his; it can agree to none but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and his glorious Bride, which is the Church.</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:66021:6"/>
               <p>But it is objected,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>1</label> that the Song ſpeaketh want only of the geſtures of Lovers, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they diſdain it, and account it not Canonical.</p>
               <p>For Anſwer: So the 45th Pſalm,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> wherein the ſame matter is handled, that is handled in this Book, may as well be accounted not Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical; the whole Pſalm being but an Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the matter herein contained. They that will take exceptions againſt this Book, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt expreſſeth himſelf after the manner of a Lover, may as well except againſt that Scripture, where the Lord ſays, <hi>Behold I come as a Thief.</hi> Now as Chriſt compares himſelf to a Thief, not becauſe he dealeth unrighteouſly, but to ſhew the ſuddenneſs of his coming: So he alſo compares himſelf to a Lover, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he delighteth in wanton geſtures, but becauſe the Love between Man and Wife, is a worthy and moſt excellent repreſentation of the Love between Chriſt and his Church.</p>
               <p>But they Object farther,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>2</label> that the Name of God is not at all uſed in this Song.</p>
               <p>This proves nothing: For it doth not follow,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> that becauſe the Name of God is often uſed in great Volums, that therefore it muſt be uſed in every Song.

                  <hi>David</hi> made an excellent Funeral Song at the burial of <hi>Saul,</hi> and yet the Name of God is not mentioned in it, and ſhall it not therefore be Canonical? If this Argument were good, then many Chapters in the Bible muſt be accounted not Canonical, for want of the Name of God being uſed in them.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:66021:7"/>
               <p>Again they ſay,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>3</label> that there is nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed of this Song in any of the Writings of the New Teſtament.</p>
               <p>So there are divers Books in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that are not mentioned in the New beſides this;
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> neither is all that Chriſt himſelf ſpake, ſet down or alleaged in the New Teſtament.</p>
               <p>Now then it muſt follow, that if this Book muſt be rejected, becauſe none of it is expreſſed in the Writings of the New Teſtament; then all other Books in the Old Teſtament, that are not ſet down in part in the New, muſt be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not Canonical. And alſo, that whatſoever Chriſt ſpake and alleaged, that was not written, muſt be accounted not to be agreeable to the Writings of the New Teſtament. All that Chriſt ſpake was not written, but only the Abridgment of things. And although the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of this Song are not ſet down in the New Teſtament, yet the Doctrine herein contained, is therein expreſſed.</p>
               <p>Therefore abiding by the Authority of it, it being a matter from Heaven, let us bring Faith along in reading of the Ditty, that our Hearts may be raviſhed with the Spiritual excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency herein contained. And ſo I come to the Title.</p>

                  <p>Some ſay, it is ſaid to be a <hi>Song of Songs,</hi> becauſe it was the manner of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> in extolling or abaſing of things, to double their Words; as when they ſay, <hi>The God of Gods,</hi> it is, God above all Gods. And, <hi>The Lord of Lords,</hi> and <hi>King of Kings;</hi> it ſignifies an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency above all Lords, and an Authority above all Kings. And ſo alſo in abaſing of things, as when <hi>Noah</hi> curſeth <hi>Cham, A Servant of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſhalt thou be;</hi> that is, a moſt vile Servant.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66021:8"/>But I ſuppoſe there is ſomething more to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in the words: For it muſt be noted, that <hi>Pſalms</hi> and <hi>Songs</hi> are Arguments of joy and gladneſs; and ſinging is a token of joy and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, out of ſome great Affliction and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. When <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barack</hi> had gotten the victory over King <hi>Jabin,</hi> King of <hi>Canaan,</hi> they ſung a Song unto the Lord. And when the Lord ſaved <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> out of the hands of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> they alſo ſung a Song. And ſo it was alſo when <hi>David</hi> returned from the ſlaughter of the <hi>Philiſtines;</hi> the Women came out of all the Cities of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſinging and dancing with Tabrets of joy, and Inſtruments of Muſic.</p>
                  <p>Now in that the Holy Ghoſt calleth this Book a Song, he ſheweth that there is matter of great joy in it. And ſeeing it is a <hi>Song of Songs,</hi> it far ſurpaſſeth all other Songs that <hi>Solomon</hi> made; as alſo all other Songs in holy Scripture: ſo that no Song can be match'd with it.</p>
                  <p>For as to the matter of it, and thing it hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, it is the Scriptural Communion between Chriſt and his Church, when ſhe is in the loweſt and ſaddeſt condition, by reaſon of her Sin and Miſery; even then this Song ſetteth out unto her the Love and tender Compaſſion of Chriſt her Bridegroom.</p>
                  <p>And as for the manner of ſetting of it forth, it is in a Dialogue or borrowed Speech, taken from Lovers that are betrothed together in the Marriage knot, wherein the Bridegroom and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:66021:8"/>the Bride declare their Affections one to another with great rejoycing; the Bridegroom praiſing and commending his Bride, in that in her miſery ſhe looked upon him; and the Bride her Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom, in that he ſheweth pity and compaſſion upon her. So that this Song goeth beyond all other Songs, in regard of the ſubject Matter of it, and thing it handleth; the very burden of it being to inſtruct us in this, <hi>That Chriſt is ours, and we are his, when Fleſh and Reaſon ſaith the contrary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>— Which is <hi>Solomon</hi>'s.</q>
                  <p>The next commendation of the Song is from the Author, which is <hi>Solomon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Solomon</hi> was a Man beſotted in his Life,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 11.4.</note> and ſtained with many foul blemiſhes, was not ſo upright in Heart as <hi>David</hi> his Father, being drawn away by his Wives to the horrible Sin of Idolatry; yet the Lord paſſed by his great and foul ſtains, and made choice of <hi>Solomon</hi> to be the Pen-man of his holy Spirit, and an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment where his Glory ſhould ſhine. The Lord did not caſt off <hi>Solomon</hi> for his ſtains and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes, but had an Eye ſtill to that good which was in him, whereby he would make him a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Inſtrument to ſet forth his Praiſe. How much the practice of Men differs from this Example of God, is eaſie to be ſeen, who will preſently caſt off all that is good in a Man, if he be but any way ſtained or polluted in his life,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:66021:9"/>if it be a Man of ever ſo excellent Parts and Gifts, able to ſet forth Heavenly myſteries, and do good to the Church of God; yet if he be but any way blemiſhed or defamed, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſet him aſide as altogether uſeleſs, and make no more account of him, than of a broken Pitcher. The Lord did not do this when he ſaw <hi>Solomon</hi> in his filthineſs, but had an Eye to that good which was in him, which made him uſeful for the good of his Church.</p>
                  <p>If God ſhould have followed the Example of Men, how ſhould this excellent <hi>Song of Songs</hi> have been had? Or how ſhould the Epiſtles of <hi>Paul</hi> have been had, if <hi>Paul</hi> had been wholly ſet aſide for his perſecuting the Church? Theſe make themſelves more pure than their Maker; elſe they would not go about to teach the Lord what Inſtruments to chuſe, to ſet forth his Glory by. They cannot be content that the Lord ſhall chuſe ſuch Inſtruments as beſt pleaſe him, but muſt needs have ſuch as beſt pleaſe them, or none at all. Like mad Men, that will rather ſtarve for hunger, than receive any Food, unleſs it be preſented in a ſilver Diſh; and dye for Thirſt, if you bring them not Drink in a golden Goblet. All Men therefore muſt humble themſelves, muſt ſtoop, and give Honour and Glory to the Lord; and ſuffer him to make choice of ſuch Inſtruments as beſt pleaſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to make his Glory ſhine, and to raiſe up his Church with Divine Contemplations. For <hi>Solomon,</hi> although he was unworthy and unfit
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:66021:9"/>to be choſen for ſuch an Inſtrument, by reaſon of his foul ſtains; yet in regard of his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Wiſdom, and great Reach, that the Lord had given him, whereby he was able to borrow Speeches from the nature of Earthly things; to ſet forth the Lord's mind in Heavenly things, he was a Man excellently fitted.</p>
                  <p>For God gave <hi>Solomon</hi> Wiſdom, and largeneſs of Heart, above all Men, his Wiſdom excelled all the Children of the Eaſt; for he was wiſer than <hi>Ethan, Henan, Calcol,</hi> and <hi>Darda.</hi> And he ſpake of Trees from the Cedar in <hi>Lebanon,</hi> to the Hyſop that groweth out of the Wall. He was able alſo to ſhew the nature of Fowls, and of Fiſhes. There was none like <hi>Solomon</hi> before him, neither after him ſhall there ariſe any like him. <hi>Solomon</hi> was alſo a Figure of Chriſt, in regard of his Wiſdom, Kingdom, and Glory, and alſo being a Man of reſt; for ſo the Lord ſaid of him, Solomon <hi>ſhall be his Name, for I will give Peace to</hi> Iſrael <hi>in his days.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now Chriſt is our Peace, who is alſo called <hi>Solomon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Pen-man therefore of this Book being the wiſeſt of all the Prophets, and Chriſt, whom it concerneth, being the very Wiſdom of the Father, and greater than <hi>Solomon,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is this Song commended unto us by the holy Ghoſt, in the higheſt degree of Excellency.</p>
                  <p>Seeing therefore it is a Song, we muſt learn with all skilfulneſs to ſing it; and ſeeing ſinging
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:66021:10"/>is an argument of joy, we muſt look for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this Song, but matter of exceeding joy: So that when we are in the loweſt condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by reaſon of Sin and the Croſs, yet then the underſtanding of this Song will raiſe us up beyond our ſelves. For it is not only a Song, but the Song of all Songs, compoſed by <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> a Perſon wiſer than all Perſons, who figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth out Chriſt unto us, who is the very Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Father, and therefore greater than <hi>Solomon:</hi> And his carriage to be moſt gentle and loving to us, when we are in the deepeſt miſery, and greateſt extremity.</p>
                  <p>Therefore we muſt endeavour to learn the Tune and Time of this Heavenly Song, and it will fill our Hearts with joy and gladneſs.</p>

Chriſt kiſſeth the Bride, when he aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth her by his word that he is reconciled to her, and in Love with her Perſon, although ſhe be a moſt miſerable Sinner. The Bride kiſſeth Chriſt, when ſhe by Faith is reconciled to him, in believing that Chriſt is in Love with her Perſon.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt offereth the kiſs firſt, in theſe words, <hi>I have loved thee with an everlaſting Love.</hi> The Bride again meeteth him with the kiſs, as ſoon as ever ſhe perceiveth, and is drawn to believe, that her very Perſon is intended in theſe words, <hi>This is the firſt kiſs of Chriſt, which begetteth Faith, and all Heavenly Qualities within us.</hi> There are alſo other kiſſes that follow where the firſt is imbraced, when he loveth our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.5.</note> although imperfect, becauſe we pleaſe him by Faith; but this is his antecedent kiſs, which reſpecteth not the Work, but the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, a moſt miſerable Sinner; and this we ought to believe. And in this ſence it is ſaid, <hi>Kiſs the Son lest he be angry,</hi>

                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.12.</note> that is, ſee that thou thankfully imbrace the firſt kiſs, which aſſureth thee of the acceptance of thy ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Perſon, before thy works are regarded, which truth of God worketh in thee Faith,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:66021:11"/>and Love to God, and all good works. In this ſence alſo it is ſaid,

                     <hi>Salute ye one another with an holy kiſs,</hi> and, <hi>Greet ye one another with an holy kiſs;</hi> by which holy Kiſs is meant the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring on Chriſt's part, and the embracing on our part the firſt kiſs. And by greeting and ſaluting one another, is ſet forth the higheſt degree of Love among the Brethren, which is a mutual forwardneſs in drawing each other by the Goſpel to receive the firſt kiſs; therefore the Bride ſaith here, <hi>Let him kiſs me,</hi> let him aſſure me in this one point that my Perſon is in his Favour; which is the firſt ground and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of our Faith in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But why doth the Bride here deſire to be kiſſed with more kiſſes beſides the firſt kiſs?

                  <p>And ſhe addeth farther, <q>—<hi>With the kiſſes of his Mouth</hi>—</q> Becauſe all the Comforts that ſhe findeth in the day of Adverſity, do proceed from the Mouth

The Law cannot comfort her in the day of diſtreſs, therefore ſhe deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth after her Lord. She forſaketh the Servant, and deſireth to be kiſſed with the kiſſes of Chriſt's mouth. Now the reaſon why ſhe deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the kiſſes of Chriſt above all others, is ſet down in the next words.</p>
                  <q>— For thy Love is better than Wine.</q>
                  <p>In which words, ſhe ſetteth out the excellency of his Love far beyond all his Gifts. Wine is an excellent gift of God, having many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Properties in it;
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.</note> it helpeth the infirmity of Man's Body; it is delightful to the Eye; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to the Taſt; but above all this, the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt ſaith,

                     <hi>It maketh glad the Heart of Man.</hi> Theſe things ſhe denieth not, but that they are very delightful; but yet ſhe eſteemeth them as nothing, in compariſon of his Love. Wine alſo was in much eſteem at Marriages, as we ſee by the Wedding Chriſt was at, when he turned Water into Wine; yet notwithſtanding all theſe, the Bride is more imflamed with the Love of his Perſon, than with the Love of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:66021:12"/>Wine; and the reaſon ſhe giveth is, becauſe his Love is better than Wine.</p>
                  <p>Which ſheweth us the right way how to have a light eſteem of all things under the Sun, which is, to faſten our Eyes upon ſomething that is better. And alſo, that when we are in the greateſt Miſery, by reaſon of Sin and the Croſs, it ſheweth us what to do, even then to deſire the apprehenſion of Chriſt's Love; and to aſſure our ſelves by Faith, that he ſpeaketh good and comfortable words unto us, and not as the Law and our own evil Conſciences doth; theſe things thou haſt done, and therefore thy Miſery is juſt. I ſay, Chriſt doth not thus ſpeak to the humbled Soul, but ceaſeth then from Rigour, parteth with his Right, and ſpeaketh the words of Grace and Conſolation to us. Therefore muſt we embrace his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly kiſs with thankful Hearts, and then ſhall we find by experience that to be true which the Bride here ſingeth, <hi>Thy Love is better than Wine.</hi>

                  <p>HEre it is farther ſhewed by the holy Ghoſt, why the Bride doth ſo much eſteem of his Love, and why her Affection is ſo much drawn to him; it is becauſe of the ſavour of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:66021:13"/>his Ointments; his Perſon is moſt excellent and ſweet; for being anointed with the Godhead, all his Actions became meritorious for her in the ſight of the Father.</p>
                  <p>For it muſt be noted, that when the nature of Man was taken by the Godhead in Unity of Perſon, it was filled with notable and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Graces; both with all created and uncrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Perfections, with Wiſdom in the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, Holineſs in the Will, Purity in the Affections, in all points, whereby the Body it ſelf became a worthy Inſtrument, for the great Work of Man's Redemption.

                  <p>And this anointing of Chriſt was ſhadowed in the Law,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.30.</note> when God did appoint that there ſhould be an anointing Oyl made of the Oyl of Olives, and other notable Perfumes, for the anointing of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, and the Veſſels of the Sanctuary; which holy Oyl was to be as a Sacrament of that moſt excellent ſweetneſs that ſhould be found in Chriſt, the high Prieſt of his Church. That even as <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, being anointed therewith, were made to ſmell ſweet in the Noſtrils of the People; ſo the Godhead did perſume the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of Chriſt, with ſuch moſt excellent ſweetneſs, whereby the ſmell of his Actions did make a moſt pleaſant Perſume for us in the fight of God the Father.</p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:66021:13"/>
                  <p>But beſides theſe Ointments of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, there were other Ointments alſo that Kings did uſe, who had (as it ſeemeth) the faireſt and ſweeteſt things that could be inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for themſelves and their Queens, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume their Clothes withall; as appears by Queen <hi>Eſther,</hi>

                        <hi>Eſth.</hi> 2.12.</note> who for certain days before ſhe came to the King, perfumed her ſelf with Oyl of Myrrhe and ſweet Odours, and other things which were appointed for the purification of Women.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Solomon</hi> alſo being a Type of Chriſt,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.</note> is ſaid to have his Garments perfumed with Myrrhe, Aloes, and Caſſia, out of the Ivory Palaces. Now, either of theſe Ointments, whether thoſe that were made for Prieſts, or the Perfume that was made for Kings, do ſerve to ſet forth the moſt excellent ſweetneſs that is in Chriſt, whereby diſtreſſed Conſciences (when once perfumed therewith) do become an Odour of a ſweet ſmelling Sacrifice in the ſight of God. And therefore Chriſt (under the Figure of <hi>Solomon</hi>) is ſaid to be anointed with the Oyl of Gladneſs,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.</note> becauſe when the Merits of his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are given to the diſtreſſed Conſcience, it is delivered from the guilt of Sin, and wrath of God: And therefore it is, that the Bride here ſpeaketh of the ſavour of his Ointments. She looketh not upon any thing of worth in her ſelf, but ſmelleth the ſavour of the good Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of her Beloved, which are as a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Balm to heal her of all her wounds, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:66021:14"/>of infinite ſweetneſs, to drive away the ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and loathſom ſmell of all her Sins from the preſence of God; whereby ſhe comes to be filled with ſweet and Heavenly delight.</p>
                  <p>Which teacheth us the true nature and uſe of Faith, which is, that when we feel the ſtink of our Sins, the grievouſneſs of our Wounds, and the loathſomneſs of our filthy Nature; not then to look after any worthineſs in our ſelves, but only to ſmell to the ſweet and precious Ointments of our Beloved; which being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented before the Juſtice Seat, do ſend forth ſuch a ſmell, that cauſeth the Father to forget the ſtink of all our Sins, and will alſo fill our Minds and Conſciences with Heavenly delight: For to this purpoſe was the Lord Jeſus Chriſt anointed, that our Minds and Conſciences might be fill'd with the ſavour thereof.</p>
                  <q>—Thy Name is as Ointment poured forth—</q>
                  <p>In which words the Bride farther amplifieth, why ſhe doth ſo much eſteem of his Love; it is from his Name: For it was promiſed concerning Chriſt, <hi>That a Virgin ſhould Conceive, and bring forth a Son, and his Name ſhall be called</hi> Emanuel; <hi>which is</hi> God <hi>with us.</hi> The underſtanding of this Name (ſhe ſaith) is as precious Ointment, becauſe through this Name, ſhe hath her Mind perfumed, and her Conſcience diſcharged from the wrath of God; for if God be preſent, the ſcar of his wrath muſt needs be abſent; <hi>If God
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:66021:14"/>be with us, who can be againſt us?</hi> There is nothing in Heaven, Earth, or Hell, can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly diſmay us, where God is preſent, being apprehended by Faith.</p>
                  <p>But there is another thing here which maketh her eſteem his Name; not only becauſe his Name is as Ointment, but alſo as Ointment poured forth.</p>
                  <p>His Name is not as Ointment kept in a Box, but as Ointment poured out. If Ointment were kept in a Box always, and not poured out, then no Man could ſmell it; but being poured out, it will make an excellent Perſume; as may be ſeen by that Ointment which <hi>Mary</hi> brought in an Alabaſter Box to anoint Chriſt withall: She breaketh the Box, and poureth it out; and it is noted,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>John</hi> 12.</note> the whole Houſe did ſmell of the Odour of it: Before the Box was broken, it did not ſmell ſo much; but after the Box was broken, and the Ointment poured out, it did ſmell exceedingly. So although the Humanity of Chriſt be filled with all Grace, that a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can be capable of, yet if no Man knew it, what were it the better? But when he is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and manifeſted to Man, then he is as an Ointment poured out; and this is done by the preaching of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>There is a double conſideration to be had, about the pouring out of Chriſt's Ointments; the one is the pouring them out upon his own doings; the other is, when the Ointment is poured out upon the Virgins.</p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:66021:15"/>
                  <p>The one of theſe pourings out reſpecteth himſelf; but the other reſpecteth fainting di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed Minds. The one is the pouring forth of his Ointments upon the Actions of the Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; the other is the pouring them forth into the Conſciences of the Redeemed. For the caſe ſtandeth thus: If the Actions that were Chriſt's own, had not been perfumed with the excellent ſavour of his Ointments, they had not been fit, nor of ſufficient worth for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; but ſeeing they were all perfumed with the Infinite Odour of the Godhead, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they became a Sacrifice of a ſweet ſmelling ſavour, acceptable to the Father. And as the Grace that is in Chriſt Jeſus, did make him ſhine and glitter in the ſight of the Father; ſo when his Ointments are poured out in the preaching of the Goſpel, it maketh him ſhine and glitter in the Conſciences of the Elect. And this is that which the Bride here hath an Eye unto, even to that which is poured upon the Virgins, whereby they came to love him, which could never be, if it were only poured upon his own doings, and no man knew it; therefore that the Virgins may love him, they muſt ſmell the ſweetneſs of the Ointments them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And this is done when it is poured out in the preaching of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>This ſheweth us, that without we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd by theſe Ointmenes, we are no better in the ſight of God than ſtinking Carrion; and that until the Goſpel hath poured out the Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:66021:15"/>we can never be perfumed thereby: Therefore when thou feeleſt the ſtink of thy Sins, make haſt to the Box of Perfume, that the ſweet Ointments may be poured upon thee. Pitiful it is, if thou know not the ſtink of thy Sins; and worſe, not to know of this Heavenly Box of Perfume; but worſt of all to thoſe that cannot abide this Heavenly Ointment, but ſtop their Noſtrils at the breaking of the Box; what will become of ſuch? But that the word to them will become a ſavour of Death unto Death. Learn thou therefore to ſmell this ſweet and heavenly Perfume, then ſhalt thou find in thy ſelf the ſame Effects that were wrought in the Virgins, as here followeth.</p>
                  <q>—Therefore the Virgins love thee.</q>
                  <p>The Church in general, and all the Members thereof in particular, are called Virgins, in reſpect of the purity of their Faith, being formed without the works of the Law. In this ſence, the Church is called a Virgin by St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2.</note> 
                     <hi>I have preſented you a pure Virgin to Chriſt.</hi> So that ſhe is a Virgin, in regard ſhe is delivered from the Law, and married to Chriſt by Faith alone. She is ignorant of the Law, knowing nothing of the Law, and her own Righteouſneſs, in the matter of her juſtification before God. She hath a ſingle Eye, beholdeth not a double object in diſtreſs of Mind, but fixeth her Eye upon Chriſt alone. If thou formeſt thy Faith
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:66021:16"/>only by the promiſe, then thou art delivered from the Law and Curſe of God; but if thou counteſt thine own Works to be Eſſential to Faith, then the Virginity of Faith is loſt; then thou doſt Adulterate from the Promiſe, and art overwhelmed with the Curſe.</p>
                  <p>This Virginity is preſerved where there is a right diſtinction taught between Faith and the Law; man's Reaſon when it heareth the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to be annexed to the Law, it preſently concludeth, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did at Mount <hi>Sinai. All that the Lord commandeth us, we will do;</hi> thinking it ſelf ſufficiently able to perform the Law: Which opinion in Man cauſeth, not only the loſs of true Virginity, but alſo of true and everlaſting Happineſs. Now there being ſo wide a difference between Faith, and Man's opinion of the Law, it will not be amiſs to conſider, what true obedience to the Law is.</p>
                  <p>There is a double Conſideration to be had about Obedience to the Law, Active and Paſſive. Active Obedience is, when thou putteſt forth all thy Abilities to perform the Law: Paſſive Obedience is, when thou ſubmit teſt thy ſelf to the condemning Power of the Law, and utterly renouncing the Law, flye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to Chriſt by Faith. This Paſſive Obedience goeth before Juſtification, forgiveneſs of Sins, and imputation of Righteouſneſs, being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to it; and Active Obedience followeth after. This Paſſive Obedience I call Obedience
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:66021:16"/>to the Law, becauſe it is required in the firſt Command ment; which forbiddeth thee to depend upon thine own Righteouſneſs, which is by the Law; and requireth thee to lay hold on <hi>the Righteouſneſs of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.21.</note> 
                     <hi>which is manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted without the Law.</hi> So that all thoſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures that require a neceſſity of the Law, as the doers of the Law ſhall be juſtified; and bleſs thoſe only that are the doers of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, intend this Active and Paſſive Obedience in order, as hath been ſaid: And therefore muſt be underſtood according to the firſt Commandment, which firſt teacheth us to hear the word of the Curſe, and to juſtifie God; and next it driveth us to the promiſe which juſtifieth us. And this is the true obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Faith, which I here call the Paſſive Obedience; which, as ſoon as thou entereſt into, thou becomeſt a pure Virgin to Chriſt, and yieldeſt thy ſelf in Marriage to the Son of God; which, as ſoon as thou apprehendeſt by Faith, thy Conſcience is made joyful and glad by the Righteouſneſs of thy Redeemer, which alſo breedeth in thee Active Obedience, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thou joyfully doſt good works unto thy Neighbour. Faith then ſeparateth between Active and Paſſive Obedience, and ſo preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth pure Virginity in the Church, for it placeth the one before, and the other after juſtification.</p>
                  <p>Where this Virginity of Faith is, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience reſteth, hopeth, and rejoyceth, in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:66021:17"/>Chriſt his Saviour; and the outward Man joyfully doth good works unto his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hour.</p>
                  <q>— Love thee.</q>
                  <p>The holy Ghoſt here ſheweth the reaſon why the Virgins fall in Love with Chriſt, which is (as was ſaid before) drawn from the ſavour of his Ointments. The firſt Commandment is, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thine Heart.</hi> But now the Queſtion is, how this Love of God ſhall be wrought in the Soul, that what is commanded in the Law may be attained to? That which is here ſet down, reſolves this Queſtion, <hi>Therefore the Virgins love thee:</hi> Not becauſe of the Law, but becauſe of the Goſpel. So that the Goſpel teacheth thee how to attain to all thoſe things which are required in the Law, namely, <hi>To love God, and thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;</hi> otherwiſe, thy Obedience is nothing worth. This had need be well underſtood by thoſe in the Miniſtry, leſt, inſtead of teaching Men to love God, they drive them from God, and cauſe them to hate and abhorr him more than they did before. Leſt inſtead of teaching the Paſſive Obedience, which breedeth Love to God, they preſs nothing but the Active Obedience, which driveth all Men from God, for it bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in Men an opinion of Righteouſneſs by the Law; which is a Sin directly againſt the firſt Commandment.</p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:66021:17"/>
                  <p>Therefore Chriſt calleth this manner of Teaching, a teaching Men to break the Law: <hi>He that breaketh the leaſt Commandment,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.19.</note> 
                     <hi>and teacheth Men ſo, ſhall be called the leaſt in the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">This teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Men to break the Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it eſtabliſheth in Men a falſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Law, which bindeth all Men under the Curſe of God.</note> Now to teach Men to break the Law, is, when no other Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is required, to make Men Holy and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in the ſight of God and Conſcience, but only the Righteouſneſs of the Law. Theſe are the leaſt, leaſt of all accounted in the ſight of God, and leaſt of all accounted on in the Church of God, becauſe they forſake the true, and lay another Foundation of Faith and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is contrary to the teſtimony of the holy Ghoſt here; and alſo contrary to the Doctrine of the firſt Commandment, as hath been ſhewed before.</p>

This ſheweth what Doctrine it is, by which the Soul is united to Chriſt; it is not done by preſſing or requiring the works of the Law, but by giving or infuſing into the Soul the Righteouſneſs of the Goſpel. For the Church is here in heavineſs and wearineſs, being not
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:66021:18"/>able of her ſelf to go nor ſtand, by reaſon of her Sin, and the greatneſs of her Affliction, by which ſhe is filled with ſo many fears and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities, that the Heart is even ready to ſink into deſpair, and to conclude, that God hath caſt it off for ever. Now what ſhall be ſaid to this miſerable Woman in this condition, that may be ſutable in order to her Peace and Comfort? Shall it be ſaid, go thy way, amend thy Life, keep the Commandments of God, and then thou ſhalt have full deliverance? This is even as for a Malefactor that is condemned by the Law, and nothing can help him but Mercy, to be ſent to his Accuſer for help and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. This is not to draw the Soul to Chriſt, but to wrap it up in Guilt and Bondage. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when thy Conſcience is in diſtreſs, thou muſt then hear no Law, but harken only to the voice of the bleſſed Son of God, which draweth thee to himſelf, not by the Law, but by the Goſpel, which delivereth thee from all thy fears and diſtreſſes, and ſettleth thee in a Kingdom of Peace and Joy. Chriſt doth not put the Conſcience in fear, as the Law doth, but ſpeaketh comfortable words to the trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling afflicted Conſcience.

                        <hi>John</hi> 8.</note> The poor Woman that was taken in Adultery, no doubt was in a trembling and very ſad condition, when ſhe was ſo vehemently accuſed by the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> when they brought her before Chriſt; <hi>Maſter</hi> (ſay they) <hi>this Woman was taken in the very act, muſt ſhe not be ſtoned?

But Chriſt maketh no anſwer to them, only writeth with his Finger on the ground, and biddeth them, He that is without Sin caſt the firſt Stone at her; and they being all convicted, went out one by one: But the Woman ſtayed, and heard Chriſt.</hi> No doubt the poor Woman could not chuſe but fall in Love with Chriſt greatly, which appeared by her ſtaying until the <hi>Phariſees</hi> were all gone, and none left but only Chriſt and her ſelf: For Chriſt did not put her in fear, (nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was ſhe afraid of him) but he asked her this Queſtion, <hi>Woman, where are thine Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers? Hath no Man condemned thee? She ſaid, No Man, Lord. And Jeſus ſaid, Neither do I Condemn thee.</hi> This was comfortable to the poor Woman that had broken the Seventh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment; for it is thus much in effect, in as much as thou hideſt not thy Sin, nor flyeſt away, but abideſt with me, and expect mercy and forgiveneſs from me, therefore behold, I will not Condemn thee, but forgive thy Sin, <hi>Go, and Sin no more.</hi> And by this means was this poor diſtreſſed Woman drawn to Chriſt, even by the loving and gentle carriage of Chriſt her Lord: For ſhe regardeth not the Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> nor yet the Accuſations of her own Conſcience, but liſteneth and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keneth very diligently to the comfortable News that the Goſpel bringeth.

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:66021:19"/>even by the King, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, her Beloved. He that might diſdain her as a Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, brought her into a place of wonderful joy and delight. Chambers are places where Secrets are uſed to be revealed.

All other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, beſides the Goſpel, do fill the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of Men full of fearfulneſs and terrour; but the Effect of the Goſpel is Righteouſneſs, Peace, and Joy, in the holy Ghoſt: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is taught how the true Paſtors (alſo) of the Church may be known. He, who by his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, worketh not Peace and Gladneſs in the Conſcience, preacheth not the Goſpel; but he
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:66021:20"/>by whoſe Principles the Conſcience is made joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, being diſcharged from the guilt of Sin, and the fear of God's wrath; he it is that rightly preacheth the Goſpel.

                        <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.21.</note> as appears by the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah.</hi> The Bride therefore in ſaying ſhe is <hi>Black,</hi> ſays, ſhe is a Mourner; which is meant, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of her outward condition here in this
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:66021:21"/>World, which cometh by reaſon of her Sin and the Croſs.
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Job</hi> 30.30.</note> Of this <hi>Job</hi> complaineth when he was in his great Affliction, <hi>My Skin</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is Black upon me.</hi> Now becauſe the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> do often-times deſpiſe the Goſpel, when they behold the People that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it to be in ſo great Affliction and Miſery, therefore the Bride directeth her Speech to them, to take away the ſcandal of the Croſs and Offences that might ariſe, and ſaith as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth in the next words:
<q>— But comely —</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is, although I am <hi>black</hi> by reaſon of my Sin and Affliction, yet I am <hi>comely</hi> in the Perſon of my Beloved, who doth not for this cauſe reject me, but joyneth himſelf unto me, and cloaths me with the Garments of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; which teacheth us the right uſe of Faith: Which is, That when a Man is as black as Hair-Cloth, by reaſon of his Sin, and the greatneſs of the Croſs; yet at that very time, to behold the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to be holding forth his promiſe of Grace and Favour to him. And alſo this is farther to be noted, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing comes between this Blackneſs and Comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but only Faith in her Redeemer. For ſhe beholdeth nothing in her ſelf, but that ſhe is covered all over with blackneſs and defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; and yet ſhe reſteth upon the promiſe of her Beloved. And thus muſt we alſo do in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:66021:22"/>time of great diſtreſs of Mind, when we are utterly void of all hope in our ſelves and all Creatures; yet then to lift up our Eyes and Hearts to our Redeemer, who looketh upon us, and joyneth himſelf unto us, to take away from us our preſent Miſeries.</p>
                  <q>— O ye Daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> —</q>
                  <p>By the Daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in this place, I underſtand, all that party in the viſible Church that are yet unconverted, being contrary in their Principles and Practiſe to the Bride.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is not only to be underſtood of the Free-Mother and Spiritual City, which bringeth forth Children free in Spirit, free from the Bondage and Curſe of the Law; but alſo of that Mother which gendereth all her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren unto Bondage.

                  </p>
                  <p>In my judgment they define not aright, that underſtand by the Daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in this Song, the Elect of God. And by the Queens and Virgins, mentioned in ſome part of this Song, Regenerate Perſons; and to be all waiters on, and well-wiſhers to the Bride; ſetting forth the Bride to be (as it were) a ſtately Queen, and all the reſt in the viſible Church to be (as it were) Ladies of Honour, that do attend and wait on the Bride.</p>
                  <p>True it is, that in the ſight of God ſhe is a thing much ſet by, ſhe hath the holy Ghoſt for her Comforter, the Angels to be her Miniſtring
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:66021:22"/>Spirits; and there is joy in Heaven at her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion: But in this World ſhe is reproached, and lightly eſteemed, even by thoſe that ſeem to carry great eſteem in the viſible Church.</p>
                  <p>I underſtand then by the Daughters of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> when they are ſpoken to by the Bride, as in this place, to mean the Children of the Bond-woman, that build upon Principles that do exclude them from the Inheritance of God; but when they are ſpoken of jointly, as in <hi>Song</hi> 3. then to mean all the Children of the Church viſible, united into Church Fellowſhip by the Signs and Seals of God's Covenant.</p>
                  <p>For the holy Ghoſt ſetteth down the two Covenants under the ſimilitude of two Mothers,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Agar</hi> and <hi>Sarah,</hi> which brought forth two ſorts of Children in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family. Now, as in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family, (which was the viſible Church of God) two ſorts of Children were born, the Children of the Bond-woman, and the Children of the Free; ſo likewiſe are there two ſorts of People brought forth in the viſible Church throughout all the World, the People of the Law, and the People of Grace. Alſo as <hi>Agar</hi> the Bond-woman brought forth a Son to <hi>Abraham,</hi> mocking and perſecuting <hi>Iſaac;</hi> ſo likewiſe Mount <hi>Agar,</hi> or <hi>Sina,</hi> bringeth forth unto God a Son, which is an Enemy to the Faith of Chriſt,</p>
                  <p>This Enmity ariſeth for want of a right underſtanding of the promiſes annexed to the Law; therefore the Bond-woman requireth the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:66021:23"/>works of the Law to be done, for the obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the promiſe, and about this point ſhe quarrelleth and contendeth with the Free Mother, who teacheth a contrary Doctrine, namely, that the Righteouſneſs of the Goſpel is to be obtained by Faith without the Law; and this point ſhe teacheth, and herein lieth the Controverſie.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two Mothers are often in this Song brought in ſpeaking one to another, chiefly in the Fifth and Sixth Chapters, where each ſide commendeth and boaſteth her own Beloved. The right underſtanding of this one thing (I humbly conceive) is the principal Key to unlock the Myſtery of the whole Song.</p>
                  <p>Now in this place the Children of the Free-Mother are brought in ſpeaking, and the ſum of the Speech is, to juſtifie her Doctrine againſt the Daughters, who conclude, that therefore ſhe is laden with ſo many and heavy Afflictions, in regard ſhe holdeth ſo wicked a Doctrine; to which ſhe maketh this Anſwer: <hi>O ye Daughters of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>ye judge my Principles to be falſe becauſe of my outward colour, which proceedeth</hi> (as ſhe ſheweth afterwards) <hi>from an outward Cauſe, to wit, the Sun, and not from any inward Principle I hold and teach: And this I tell you far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that although I am black and deformed in your ſight, yet am I a comely Perſon in the ſight of my Beloved; for being covered with his white Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, his own Righteouſneſs, my blackneſs is taken away, and I am comely in his ſight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:66021:23"/>
                  <p>She confeſſeth that ſhe is black, in regard of her own Righteouſneſs, yet ſhe holdeth this faſt notwithſtanding, <hi>that ſhe is comely in Chriſt's ſight,</hi> which teacheth us the true Rule of Faith; which is firſt to confeſs our blackneſs before God, before we apply unto our ſelves, that we are made comely through Chriſt. For as he that preſenteth his own Righteouſneſs before God, excludeth himſelf from Chriſt, ſo he that by Faith preſenteth himſelf a Sinner before him, joyneth himſelf to Chriſt. And this Rule muſt we all learn, which is, Firſt, by Faith to preſent our ſelves before God confeſſing our Sins, that ſo by the ſame Faith we may be joyned to the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt our Lord; then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we are of an evil colour in reſpect of our outward hiew, yet ſhall we appear of a comely colour in the ſight of Chriſt our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved.</p>
                  <p>And alſo then may we eaſily overcome the Daughters, who all ſtick upon this Propoſition, and conclude, thou wanteſt the Righteouſneſs of the Law, therefore thou art condemned. To which we muſt anſwer, I grant the premiſes, but deny the Concluſion. I confeſs I want the Righteouſneſs of the Law; but I have another Righteouſneſs, even the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, by which I am juſtified and ſaved.</p>

                  <q>— As the Tents of <hi>Kedar</hi> —</q>
                  <p>Now here ſhe ſetteth out her deformity by a compariſon, <hi>The Tents of Kedar.</hi> The <hi>Keda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rims</hi> dwelt in black and hairy Tents, were a Warlike People, and never built Houſes; but being keepers of Cattel, had their Tents in open Fields; ſuch as Gentlemen have at Court, or Men of War lying open to the Air.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Tents of theirs were deformed, partly by the Sun, and partly by Storms and Weather, and were not of any outward beauty; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Bride is compared to theſe Tents.

<q>— As the Curtains of <hi>Solomon.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>King <hi>Solomon</hi> had a very rich and ſumptuous Bed, as is to be ſeen in <hi>Song</hi> 3. for the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Daughter, and other of his Queens. And as he made himſelf a Bed,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:66021:24"/>ſo he had Curtains alſo pertaining to the Bed, which Curtains were not only for Ornament to adorn the Bed, but alſo for uſe to preſerve it from defilement. And <hi>Solomon</hi> being a King excelling in Riches and Wiſdom, no doubt his Curtains were very rich and glorious.</p>
                  <p>Now as King <hi>Solomon</hi> had a Bed for the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of his Queen, ſo the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath a Bed, wherein he entertaineth his Queen; and the Bed of Chriſt is his Church, in which Company he delighteth himſelf. And the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains about this Bed are the Saints, which do adorn the Bed, in keeping the Doctrine of Chriſt pure, from being defiled.

                  <p>And in this ſenſe the Bride ſaith here, ſhe is comely, not only in reſpect of her Faith towards God, but alſo in that ſhe is an Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

                  <p>IT is as much as to ſay this, Look not upon me with contempt, to deſpiſe the Doctrine I profeſs, nor yet upon my ſtains and blemiſhes, as if I were caſt off and rejected of my Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; for although my Skin be of an evil colour, this doth not proceed from any evil there is in the Goſpel, but from an outward cauſe, to wit,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:66021:25"/>the Sun; the Sun hath looked upon me, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would not be deſpiſed, and counted a Caſt away, for it is not my natural hew, I am comely in the ſight of my Beloved. True it is, I have ſome troubles upon me, my Mother's Children do afflict me. There be many of the ſame Linage I am of, in reſpect of the outward ſtate of the Church, we have all one Mother; but they have not the Spirit of Adoption, to become the Children of my heavenly Father. My Mother's Sons have not true Faith in Chriſt, nor Hearts to live, as Brethren and Siſters ought to do: For although we were born in one Houſe, and brought up in one Family, did all eat the ſame Spiritual Meat, and drink the ſame Spiritual Drink; Yet they are fallen away by evil Principles, and into an evil courſe of Life; and becauſe I am not willing to follow their evil ways in Life and Doctrine, therefore they are angry with me. They have canker'd Minds, full of malice, and very much enflamed againſt me; for when I was about mine own buſineſs in the Lord's Vineyard, to do good to every Vine, according to my power and skill, they made me (through my own frailty and weakneſs) to look to other Vines; not only to do ſuch Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, obſerve ſuch Ceremonies, and preach ſuch Doctrines, as I was never appointed to do; but alſo ſought to draw me quite away from the Lord's Vineyard, to other Vineyards: And to perſuade me hereunto, they would make me a Keeper; they would ſet me in an Office to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:66021:26"/>keep out the defiled and unclean, leſt their Vineyard ſhould be ſpoiled by evil Beaſts: And while I was thus imployed, yielding my ſelf too much this way, they brought me quite out of Love with my own Vineyard, mine own Vineyard have I not kept; and in forſaking mine own Vineyard, which I too much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to, I had even loſt the benefits of Chriſt my Lord and Saviour.</p>
                  <p>The Bride here ſheweth, that although ſhe be black and ſtained, and out of countenance, yet ſhe would not be look'd upon proudly, with diſdain and contempt, but as an object of Pity and Mercy; yet this ſhe ſheweth to be the practiſe of the Daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in all Ages of the Church, to cover all things that is comely in the Bride, to bury that in Oblivion, but to faſten their Eyes very heedfully upon that which is her blackneſs and deformity. Such is the infirmity of Man's nature, that if there be any blemiſhes and ſtains in others, that we curiouſly obſerve, and ſuffer our Affections to be even quite abated from them therefore; but if there be any thing worthy of Praiſe, that we skip over and take little notice thereof. That which is good in us, we would have all Men look upon, and have us in high eſtimation for; but in dealing with other Men, we behold every ſpot, blemiſh, and ſtain. All Men are willing to have their own deformities skipped over, and their vertues highly praiſed and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured; but are loth to take any notice of the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:66021:26"/>vertues in others, although they be ever ſo excellent and worthy of praiſe. But why do we look upon that which deſameth the Perſon in ſome things? And do not as well behold that which will ſet him out in other things. If there be ſome blemiſh in an Houſe, we take not much notice of it, but, moſt of all, behold that which will make it ſaleable: Or, if a ground be infected with Herbs and Roots, that in ſome reſpects may be unprofitable; yet, if in other reſpects they are uſeful, we account of them, and cheriſh them. Now, if in Herbs and Roots we reſpect the vertues, as well as the baſeneſs, why do not we the like by the Church of God? Why do not we mark the beſt things to help to inflame Charity, and to nouriſh true Chriſtian Love, as well as to faſten our Eyes upon the deformities of the Church, which is the ready way to ſeparate our Affections from it.</p>
                  <p>She alſo complaineth farther, than in leaning too much to her Mother's Sons, ſhe forſook (as it were) the fruit of her own Vineyard, even the Righteouſneſs of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Of this ſort of People the Church of God hath ever been peſtered withall, ſuch that fall away themſelves, and then ſeek to draw Diſciples after them; ſome to follow Rules and Orders which are not commanded, that live within the Church, and to draw Men into an evil courſe of Life, and others which ſeek to draw Men from the Lord's Vineyard, unto
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:66021:27"/>other Vineyards, whereby they come to loſe the Fruits of Chriſt's Death and Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. For it muſt well be noted, that although in ſeparation from Churches, a great ſhew of Holineſs, may be pretended; yet under that ſhew of Holineſs, the greateſt Sin lyeth hid, which is a departing from the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>And the reaſon is, becauſe the ground of ſeparating from one Church to another, is not becauſe the gifts of God are wanting, in the Church ſeparated from, which are the Word and Sacraments, but becauſe of Men's corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions; neither is the ground of their uniting into another Church fellowſhip, becauſe of the word of God, but the works of Men. Now becauſe they make another ground of Church fellowſhip, which is not the Goſpel, preferring the abominable works of Men, before and beyond the Word and Righteouſneſs of God, having nothing to glory in, but only in the Act of Separation; therefore by the very Act of Separation, the Fruits of the Vineyard are loſt. And this is that which the Bride here toucheth upon, and confeſſeth ſhe did yield too much this way; (and about this point moſt that are godly, firſt or laſt are tottering) yet ſhe reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered her ſelf, and confeſſeth, that ſhe had rather forſake her Mother's Sons, although they be angry with her, than by following their Doctrine and way to loſe the Fruits of her own Vineyard, and purchaſe the diſpleaſure of her Beloved.</p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:66021:27"/>
                  <p>Therefore let every Man in the Church of God keep to his own Vineyard, and do the Lord's work; firſt in looking to himſelf, then in plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the young Vines: Alſo in nouriſhing thoſe that are planted, there is work for every Man to do, and God will give a liberal Reward in the end; every Man at the laſt ſhall have his Penny.</p>

                     </label> becauſe ſhe perceiveth in him the nature and properties of Love, for he giveth unto her freely that which ſhe loſt in Adam, which is, deliverance from the Curſe, and everlaſting Condemnation: Therefore it is, that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:66021:28"/>ſhe loveth him with her Soul; and this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſhe hath by Faith alone, and not from her Works: for although by Works ſhe manifeſteth her Faith before Men, yet nothing can evidence Faith to her own Conſcience, but only Faith it ſelf.
<note place="margin">The laſt Reſolution of Faith is, when the Evidence of Works is loſt, and nothing is left to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure us but the Word alone.</note> For nothing can evidence Faith in the laſt Reſolution of it to be Faith, but the infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Grace into the Soul, without precedent preparation; but in all Works there muſt be ſome precedent Preparative to make them good. Now what ever that precedent Preparative is that makes them good Works, the ſame is the Light and Evidence of Faith it ſelf; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can evidence Works (to us) to be good but Faith; therefore Faith alone muſt evidence it ſelf in the laſt Reſolution of Faith, it alone being infuſed into the Soul, without any prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent preparation.

                  <p>THeſe words are the Anſwer of Chriſt to the Churches requeſt, wherein he ſheweth his Compaſſion to her, although ſhe was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in ſome things, and therefore he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth her thus: If thou knoweſt not aright the place where I feed, yet I account of thee, therefore be not diſmayed, thy Perſon is in favour, for thou art to me <hi>the faireſt amongſt Women;</hi> therefore hearken to me, and follow my direction: <hi>Go thy way forth by the Foot-ſteps of the Flock.</hi> Mark the track of all the Flock
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:66021:29"/>that went before thee, Patriarchs, Prophets, and Apoſtles, and other holy Men of God, that both knew my voice, and followed me; and ſee where they did feed, and what they reſted on in the heat of the day, and when thou haſt found the track, there <hi>feed thy Kids by the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds Tents.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt here termeth his Bride, <hi>The faireſt amongſt Women,</hi> although ſhe hath many imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in her; and the reaſon is, becauſe he covereth all her deformities with his own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and Merits; therefore he taketh plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in her, hideth all her ſtains and blemiſhes, and mentioneth nothing but her fairneſs and beauty.</p>
                  <p>This is contrary to the practice of the World, who walk after another Rule; who, if they ſee a Man that profeſſeth Religion to be filled with many excellent Vertues that be worthy of praiſe, yet if they can (with their curious Eyes) but ſee any imperfection in him, they quickly ſet him upon the Stage, to make him a ſpectacle to all the World. They are willing to behold his ſtains and blemiſhes, and to cover him with Infamy and Reproach; but they bury all things that are comely in him in the Grave of Oblivion. Theſe, by their deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing others, do highly magnifie themſelves; but if they follow the Rules of Chriſt in other things, (as they ſuppoſe they do) why do they not alſo follow the Example of Chriſt in this, which of all others is ſo worthy of imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:66021:30"/>Why do they walk ſo directly contrary to Chriſt, and to that which is the principal Duty in practical new Obedience? Chriſt by his Righteouſneſs covereth the deformities of the humbled Sinner, and calleth him the faireſt; theſe, by their Righteouſneſs, cover all things that are worthy of praiſe, and upon the ſight of ſome imperfections, count him the filthieſt of all others. This is a ſhame to all that account themſelves Chriſtians, eſpecially to thoſe that eſteem themſelves great in the Church, being Teachers of others, who talk much of the Goſpel in their Doctrine; but why do they throw it down by their practice? Doth not the Goſpel principally teach Pity and Compaſſion towards Men, even as God hath ſhewed Pity and Compaſſion towards us? If theſe Men were ſo Righteous indeed, as they ſeem to be in their own Eyes, would they not then do to others, as they would be done unto themſelves? They themſelves are willing to have their own Vertues praiſed, and their Deformities buried, and this they greedily gape after; but in dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with others, they make them as the filth of the World, and the off-ſcouring amongſt Men. Now who ſhall cover the Deformities of theſe Men before God, when they will ſhew no Pity nor Compaſſion to their Brethren before Men? How far theſe Men are beſides the Mark, it is eaſie for all Men to judge.</p>
                  <p>Let every poor humbled Sinner therefore receive the Conſolation of Chriſt here, and not
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:66021:30"/>be too much diſmayed at his own deformity, nor yet too much dejected with the Reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Men. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>If thou know not, yet thou art to me the faireſt amongſt Women.</hi> Knowledge is the Eye of the Soul, which ought to be the guide of all Men's Actions, and the Eye being blemiſhed, a great part of the Churches beauty is ſtained and defaced, yet then if we ſeek unto him (as the Church doth here) and humble our ſelves before him, he will ſpeak loving and comfortable words unto us.</p>
                  <p>The Church is alſo directed in this Verſe to feed her Kids by the Shepherds Tents.</p>
                  <p>It muſt be noted, that the Shepherds Tents were always where the Ark was, which was the viſible Sign of God's Preſence. When the Ark of God was in <hi>Shiloh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.</note> the Shepherds Tents were there. And when the Ark was brought into the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> then the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds Tents were there. And in <hi>Num.</hi> 2.17. we read, that the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were to pitch their Tents about the Tabernacle, (of which the <hi>Levites</hi> had the charge) becauſe the Ark was there. And as the Camp of the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> was ſet forwards with the Tabernacle, ſo every Man in his place was to ſet forwards by his Standard. But with us the Ark of God is <hi>Baptiſm,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.</note> becauſe <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is the viſible Sign to which the promiſe of Chriſt's Preſence is made.</p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:66021:31"/>
                  <p>Now in that it is ſaid, <hi>There feed thy Kids,</hi> it ſheweth where the true Church is, even where the Ark is. <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> then are the Shepherds Tents. Not a reſting in the work done; but where the right reaſon of their Inſtitution is preſerved and taught, there are the true Shepherds, and there is good feeding.</p>
                  <p>Now in that it is ſaid, <hi>Feed thy [Kids],</hi> it ſheweth, that the Flock of Chriſt conſiſteth of little Kids, as well as of greater and ſtronger Cattel;
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.</note> ſo Chriſt is ſaid, to <hi>gather the Lambs in his Arms:</hi> Which ſheweth, he hath not only Sheep, but alſo Lambs in his Flock.</p>
                  <p>And alſo it being ſaid, <hi>[there] feed thy Kids,</hi> it teacheth us this; that the Mother cannot have any feeding for her little Kids, unleſs ſhe bring them firſt under the promiſe of God: So that even as the natural Mother can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not feed her Babe, unleſs ſhe give it the Teat; no more can the Spiritual Mother feed her little Kids, unleſs ſhe firſt bring them to the Ark. Learn therefore the true knowledge of the Ark, then thou haſt found the Shepherds Tents; thither bring thy Kids, and feed them with Heavenly nouriſhment.</p>

                  <p>IN the former Verſe the Church is commended for her Courage and Skill, in making War againſt her Spiritual Enemies; here ſhe is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for her Beauty. Some ſay, the modeſty of the Church is here praiſed, which appeareth
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:66021:32"/>in her Cheeks when ſhe bluſheth for ſhame, having ſinned againſt God. But the words are an Allegory, wherein one thing is expreſſed, and another thing is meant; therefore we are not to underſtand by the Cheeks and Neck the Complexion of the Face, but what ever may make the Bride beautiful and comely to behold. That which gives light for the opening of this place, is in <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.15. <hi>The Lips of Knowledge are a precious Jewel.</hi> And <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.8, 9. The <hi>Law</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>an Ornament to the Head, and as Chains about the Neck.</hi> By which Scriptures it appeareth, that as the fine Women in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s time did uſe to adorn their Cheeks and Necks with Jewels, ſet in rows, and Chains of Gold, for an addition of their Beauty; ſo alſo the Church is adorned with Jewels, Chains of Gold, and Ornaments about her Head and Neck, which is a right knowledge and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Law of Grace, which maketh her to appear beautiful and glorious. Alſo it is noted by ſome, that the word <hi>Tor,</hi> which ſignifies a Row (having Affinity with the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>Torah,</hi> which hath the name of the Law, which is as Chains) is uſed alſo for a Turtle Dove, and then the words may be read thus; <hi>Thy Cheeks are comely with rows of Jewels, wherein are Figures of Turtles.</hi> And the Turtle Doves were to be uſed in offering Sacrifice, which Offerings and Sacrifices were Types and Figures of Chriſt's ſufferings in the Fleſh.</p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:66021:33"/>
                  <p>Now this teacheth us, Firſt, what it is that doth beſpangle the Church (as it were) with Chains and Jewels, even the right underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and opening of God's Law;
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.12.</note> therefore the Doctrine of the Goſpel is compared to Gold, Silver, and precious Stones. And the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows or Lights of the Church to Agates, and the laying of her Foundation is ſaid to be with Saphirs,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.19.</note> and all manner of precious Stones; which things, as they do wonderfully ſhine and glitter in the Eyes of Men, ſo the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and opening of the Myſtery of the Goſpel, doth make the Church to ſhine and glitter in the Eyes of all thoſe that reliſh the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Next (in that the Cheeks are comely with Figures of Turtles) it teacheth us, that as ſoon as the Church is adorned with Jewels and Chains as aforeſaid, as ſoon as once her Doctrine comes to make a glittering in the Church, it bringeth upon her the Image or Figure of the Turtle, that is to ſay, Perſecution and the Croſs: She is brought into a ſuffering condition for Chriſt's ſake, and here ſhe is commended and ſaid to be beautiful and very comely, in that ſhe patiently beareth the Image or Figure of the Turtle, in ſuffering Calamities for Chriſt's ſake; which Calamities will come whereſoever the Goſpel is truly preached; and therefore the Cheeks of the Church are here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.</p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:66021:33"/>
                  <p>And thus when the ſufferings of Chriſt were ſpoken of by the Prophet, it is ſaid,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.</note> 
                     <hi>I gave my Back to the Smiters, and my Cheeks to them that plucked off the Hair;</hi> where the Cheeks and the Back only are named, for all Chriſt's ſufferings, in regard of his Humanity. And thus it is with the Church here. So <hi>Jeremiah</hi> endured ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and <hi>Paul</hi> buffettings; but every buffet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that comes upon the Face for Chriſt's ſake and the Goſpel, although it marr the Viſage in the ſight of Men; yet it is (as it were) the planting of a Jewel in the ſight of God.</p>
                  <p>He then that deſireth to be ſpangled with rows of Jewels, and Chains of Gold, muſt be ſure to learn, in the firſt place, the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Law of Grace, that his Doctrine may make a glittering in the Church,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eze.</hi> 16.10.</note> that the Heavenly City may be cloathed with broidered work, and (as it were) decked with Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and the Conſciences of poor diſtreſſed Sinners may be garniſhed with all manner of precious Stones, whereby they may be ſecured from the wrath of God.</p>
                  <p>Next, he muſt arm himſelf quietly and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to ſuffer for the Goſpel. Then are the Cheeks comely with rows of Jewels; then thou doſt rightly bear the Image and Figure of the Turtle Dove, even of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath loved thee, and ſuffered for thee.</p>

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:66021:35"/>refreſh themſelves at Dinner, or at Break-faſt. So that Chriſt's ſitting at Repaſt, is his ſitting in Compaſs. And the Compaſs or Circle that he ſits in is the Earth, with his Choſen on Earth; ſo that in all places where his Choſen are, there ſitteth Chriſt at Repaſt.

This bundle of Myrrhe (ſhe ſaith) my Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved is unto me; ſo that when I am afflicted, in heavineſs, and great diſtreſs, the ſmelling to this Bag, Bundle, or Poſey of Myrrhe, yieldeth unto me a moſt fragrant ſcent.</p>
                  <q>—He ſhall lye all Night between my Breaſts.</q>
                  <p>In theſe words is ſhewed the uſe of this Bundle, or Poſey of Myrrhe, it is to lye between her Breaſts, which words we muſt underſtand, otherwiſe the ſweetneſs of the Bundle will be utterly loſt.</p>
                  <p>Underſtand that by Night ſhe meaneth all times of Affliction, and fears of the Law, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be fear of wrath, of guilt, of want, of reproach and contempt of the World, or
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:66021:36"/>whatſoever elſe may make the Heart heavy and ſad; in which condition are we, for whom this poſey is provided, commonly caſt into, not becauſe our Heavenly Father doth delight to afflict us, but becauſe without it we can never underſtand nor ſmell the ſweetneſs of the gum. Now what courſe doth ſhe take for the baniſhing of all fears and perplexities, out of her mind and conſcience in this night of diſtreſs? It is here anſwered, ſhe lodgeth Chriſt between her breaſts, ſhe holdeth him faſt by faith; and maketh application of his gracious promiſes, againſt all fears and diſcomforts whatſoever. And this is the true uſe of the goſpel. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt learn with the bride here, to be provided with this bag or bundle of <hi>Myrrhe,</hi> againſt the night of affliction cometh, that ſo when all things that make for our diſcomfort, will ſeem to be preſent, and thoſe things which ſhould comfort us will ſeem to be abſent, and nothing will appear before our eyes, but the remembrance of what we have done: yet then, by having this Heavenly poſey in a readineſs to ſmell to, the ſweetneſs of the gum may drive away all noiſom fumes out of our minds and conſciences. So wonderful a thing is faith, that when once it layeth hold on Chriſt, and lodgeth him within the Soul; all fears and doubts muſt vaniſh before it, even as the miſt before the Sun.</p>

                  <p>THis is the ſpeech of Chriſt, who beholding his ſpouſe, declaring the uſe of her faith in the time of tribulation, commendeth her for the ſame, which ſheweth that he is well pleaſed. And the word <hi>[behold]</hi> ſheweth his willingneſs

                  <p>Learn we therefore, that Doctrine which maketh the fruitful bed, and ſheweth the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Mother, that is, ſo to underſtand the Law, as it may further us to faith in Chriſt, and ſo to underſtand the Goſpel, that it may further us in the duties of the Law.</p>

And in that ſhe is ſaid to be the Lilly of the valleys, it ſheweth from whence the Church ſpringeth, even from a low opinion of her ſelf; in that the Mountains of her own imaginations are become a valley: So that as the choiſeſt Lillies are found in the loweſt valleys, ſo the Lilly of Chriſt becomes decked with ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ornaments, being firſt made low by ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the deſert and ſolitary place.</p>
                  <p>Now it being ſaid, <hi>I am the Roſe of Sharon, and I am the Lilly;</hi> it muſt lead us into a further conſideration: for it is as much as to ſay, I am the faireſt flower in <hi>Sharon,</hi> I am the choiceſt Lilly there.

                  <p>For it muſt be noted, that <hi>Sharon</hi> is a ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold,

                  <p>And by thus ſaying ſhe boaſteth not in her ſelf; but gloryeth only in the righteouſneſs of Chriſt her Redeemer.</p>
                  <p>Now the reaſon why ſhe bloſſoms, and comes to be ſo fruitful is, becauſe ſhe is married unto Chriſt.
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſa.</hi> 35, 2.</note> This is the reaſon given by the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> (when he ſays, the wilderneſs ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, and the deſert ſhall bloſſom as the Roſe) the glory of <hi>Lebanon</hi> ſhall be given unto it, the excellency of <hi>Carmel</hi> and <hi>Sharon;</hi> meaning Chriſt, who is the excellency of <hi>Carmel</hi> and <hi>Sharon,</hi> and the glory of all the <hi>Cedars</hi> in <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banon,</hi> ſhall be given in Marriage to the deſart and ſolitary, to ſhe that is barren and fruitleſs in her own eyes. <hi>Carmel</hi> was a fruitful place where <hi>Nabal</hi> had poſſeſſions, and <hi>Sharon</hi> alſo was a fruitful field, and in <hi>Lebanon</hi> were many goodly <hi>Cedars;</hi> (figuring the Godly people in all ages of the Church) but take away the glory of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> and the excellency of <hi>Carmel</hi> and <hi>Sharon,</hi> that is to ſay, the righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed, and their glory departeth like a Bird, and their fruit withereth and comes to nothing.</p>
                  <p>After the ſame manner muſt we with the Bride, learn to hold faſt our Title againſt the bondwoman and her Children, who by their Doctrine bring forth all manner of Sects; and every Sect do claim unto themſelves the Title, as to be the only Roſe and Lilly of Chriſt: and condemn all others as <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> that are not of their own way, and yet they boaſt
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:66021:43"/>of nothing but of their own works. Now when this comes to paſs, we muſt learn with the Bride, to ſtrip them of their glory by the word of God.

A ſhadow <hi>(in Divinity)</hi> repreſenteth ſomething to faith, which is abſent to ſenſe and reaſon; confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that to the eye, which the word doth to the ear. For God hath always made a double Declaration of his bounty, for the comfort of ſinful man; the one is by his word wherein he inſtructeth us by hearing, the other by figures and ſhadows, wherein he inſtructeth us by ſeeing. And this comes to paſs by reaſon of our wonderful neceſſity and weakneſs, being not able to comprehend ſo excellent a myſtery as the Goſpel, without the uſe of viſible helps.</p>
                  <p>Therefore Chriſt inſtructing <hi>Nicodemus</hi> in the Doctrine of regeneration,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.</note> teacheth him by figures to underſtand the Myſtery. If I have told you of earthly things, and ye beleive not, how can ye beleive if I tell you of Heavenly things? As much as to ſay, unleſs you learn to believe by the knowledg of earthly things, ye cannot beleive if I tell you of Heavenly things.</p>
                  <p>Now by earthly things he meaneth the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures and ſhadows of Chriſt in all ages of the

                  <p>Theſe were the patterns of things in the Heavens, to lead the <hi>Jew</hi> to the knowledg of Heavenly things themſelves. Now therefore, as ſhadows were neceſſary to inſtruct the <hi>Jew</hi> in his Faith, in a Chriſt that was to come: So alſo were ſome ſhadows neceſſary to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the gentile in his faith, in the Chriſt that is come.
<note place="margin">

                  <p>For all the Law and the Prophets propheſied until <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> that is till Baptiſm. Now all the Law and Prophets propheſied of a Chriſt to come:
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.31.</note> But Baptiſm manifeſteth unto us the Chriſt that is come. Now ſeeing Baptiſm endeth that faith and Religion which reſteth in a Chriſt to come; therefore it beginneth that Faith and Religion which reſteth in the Chriſt that is come.</p>
                  <p>And therefore it is ſaid by the Evangeliſt,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.</note> 
                     <hi>that Baptiſm is the beginning of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God:</hi> Becauſe it endeth the former Propheſie of a Chriſt to come, and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:66021:45"/>beginneth that Faith and Religion, which reſteth in Chriſt that is come. And even as no man could viſibly profeſs the true Religion amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> unleſs he were firſt united to the <hi>Jew</hi> by Circumciſion: So no man can ſo much as profeſs the true Religion now, unleſs he be firſt united to the Church through Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>And as it is the beginning of our entrance into the way of Chriſtianity: So it is the beginning of our comfort in the day of diſtreſs, for even as Chriſt was preſent with the Fathers of old, as ſoon as by faith they rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the ſhadows; ſo Baptiſm as oft as we fly unto it by faith, hath Chriſt preſent with all that he is, and all that he hath prepared for poor ſinners. Which ſpiritual coming of Chriſt into the Soul; cauſeth the abſence of all diſcomforts whatſoever. The right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of this Miſtery, cauſeth the bride to ſing here, I ſate down under his ſhadow with great delight.</p>
                  <p>Alſo this Doctrine openeth a light for the conviction of all falſe Prophets whatſoever; all Sects and Hereſies that now be, or ever will be having their firſt riſe, from the contempt of Baptiſm, or ſome falſe opinion concerning the ſame.</p>
                  <p>And with this propoſition they all begin, that Baptiſm is nothing unleſs the perſon firſt believe. By which propoſition they wholy deny the true Chriſt, and reſt upon a falſe
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:66021:46"/>Chriſt. For Baptiſm not only manifeſteth the true Chriſt to become, (as hath been proved) but alſo ſheweth us, that until Baptiſm, all people are under the Prophecy of a Chriſt to come.</p>
                  <p>Now that Doctrine which requireth faith before Baptiſm, requireth faith not in the true Chriſt that is come, but in a falſe Chriſt which is yet to come, which Chriſt in Scripture is no where to be found.</p>
                  <p>And if there be no ſuch Chriſt to be found, which is yet to come; then there is no object to be found for ſuch a faith to reſt upon.</p>
                  <p>By which one argument, (if thou manage it skilfully) thou mayeſt eaſily ſend the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer propoſition to Satan from whence it came, and ſit down and reſt thy ſelf in peace, and joy.</p>
                  <p>For one of theſe propoſitions muſt needs be granted, that either our faith muſt be in a Chriſt that is come, or elſe in a Chriſt that is to come; if in a Chriſt that is come, then Baptiſm is neceſſary which manifeſteth the ſame,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Job.</hi> 1.31.</note> if in a Chriſt to come, then is our faith and Religion ended, ever ſince the days of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Learn thou therefore to be very cunning in the right uſe of the figure, that as Satan hath built up his Kingdom, by bringing Baptiſm into contempt; So thou mayeſt break his head, and batter his Kingdom in pieces, by teaching a right knowledg and underſtanding of the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:66021:46"/>ſame; then ſhalt thou be a right Souldier for thy beloved, and alſo with the bride here, ſhalt ſit down under his ſhadow with great delight.</p>
                  <q>—His fruit was pleaſant to my taſt.</q>
                  <p>That is, the fruit of his ſhadow, becauſe the ſhadow repreſenteth to us, the benefits of Chriſts death and Reſurrection; which muſt needs be pleaſant where the benefit is felt. But where there is no faith to underſtand and receive the myſtery in the ſhadow, to them they are of no uſe at all; but otherwiſe they are very pleaſant: for as much as they make the benefits of Chriſt which are repreſented, to be as certain to faith, as the figure repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting, is certain to ſenſe and reaſon.</p>

Now as the uſe of the Enſign is to draw Souldiers together, that they may march accordingly: So is Chriſt banner to draw all his Souldiers to himſelf, that they may joyfully fight againſt the world, the fleſh, and the Devil. And as in all ages the Churches banners were the ſigns of Gods preſence: ſo have we alſo the ſignes of his preſence in the Sacraments, and by gathering to thoſe Enſigns, the love of God comes to be ſhed abroad in the heart, by which we joyfully fight againſt all our Spiritual enemies. Therefore thoſe that come not to their Colours, but forſake their Enſigns are blind and ſenſeleſs, and not only remain without the feeling of Gods love:

But Chriſt teacheth thee far otherwiſe, for after the Conſcience is humbled by the Law: he raiſeth it up again by faith without the Law.

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:66021:51"/>ſaith, is my beloved: He maketh haſt to remove all ſtumbling blocks, that Salvation may come into my Soul, but there is ſomething in me that hindereth the coming in of Chriſt and Salvation, and that is a wall: So that when Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the Soul to make it his Habitation, he findeth the door ſhut, and a wall to keep him out.</p>
                  <p>The wall here importeth ſomething of weight, as appeareth by the word <hi>[behold]</hi> I conceive that by the wall is meant, mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural imagination, reaſon, or underſtanding, that he hath of the Scriptures, and of him ſelf which ſtandeth as a wall in man; in direct oppoſition to faith in Chriſt. For all men na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally are of this opinion, that God will juſtify thoſe that keep the Law morally, and reject the reſt: and to ſtrengthen this opinion many Scriptures are alleaged, with being not underſtood, this opinion is increaſed. Now until this wall be thrown down there is no entrance for Chriſt, therefore when the bride ſays, <hi>he ſtandeth behind our wall;</hi> ſhe meaneth to throw down the wall. Chriſt is as a lover that will come in, although the oppoſition be ever ſo great the walls muſt go down, and the houſe muſt be pulled in pieces, and a new foundation laid; So that a man would judge when Chriſt cometh that all were going to ruin, even then when he is about to lay a new foundation.</p>

                  <p>This oppoſition Chriſt findeth more or leſs, even in his own people while they are in this world, and therefore he ſtandeth behind the wall; and the firſt thing he doth by his Miniſtry is to throw down the wall: that is, thoſe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations in man, that are the roots and grounds of unbelief.</p>
                  <p>He doth not as (ſome other) builders do, prop up the old foundation, or piece up the old wall; but maketh all things new. And this was prophecied of him in <hi>Num.</hi>

So that the voice of the <hi>Turtle</hi> is a certain ſign that the ſpring is come. So when we hear the <hi>Nittingale,</hi> the <hi>Thruſh,</hi> the <hi>Black-bird,</hi> and other harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical voices and pleaſant notes; we know the ſpring is come. Now as the voice of the <hi>Turtle,</hi> and the chirping of other Birds; do ſhew unto us that Summer is come: So alſo we know that the Goſpel is come when the voice of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is heard amongſt the Saints. For as the warmneſs of the ſpring, cauſeth a cheerfulneſs amongſt the Brids: So doth the truth of the Goſpel (being rightly underſtood) cauſe a cheerfulneſs amongſt the Saints, which cauſeth all the Heavenly hoſt to break out in ſinging, lauding, and praiſing the Lord. When once they begin to ſhake off
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:66021:55"/>the winter, and the froſt begins to melt, and their hearts begin to be warmed with the ſpirit of God: then they begin to ſet their voices in Tune, and with ſweet and Heavenly deſcant to make melody to the Lord in their hearts.

                  <p>They that have nothing in their mouths but ribaldry and filthineſs, that can talk of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but couetouſneſs and greedineſs; ſhew no tokens at all of the ſpring, neither can ſuch make any Muſick at all to the Lord. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us learn rightly to underſtand the voice of the <hi>Turtle;</hi> that we may have this heat of affection within us, <hi>and ſo lively a feeling of the Lords mercies, that we may ſing forth the praiſes of the Lord, and ſhew the Turtle to be amongſt us, and that the ſpring is come:</hi> that ſo by our ſpiritual and Heavenly joy begun in this life, we may give a glymps of that everlaſting joy, which one day we ſhall have with the Lord in glory.</p>

                  <p>This ſheweth that where the Goſpel cometh it maketh men fruitful: for the godly are not compared to Trees that bring forth no fruit, (when once God pardoneth the imperfections and blemiſhes of his Church) but to Trees that bring forth moſt ſweet and pleaſant fruit. Thoſe that bring forth no fruit in their converſation, <hi>but ſower grapes are not the Lords plants: but are degenerated from the true vine.</hi> And they whoſe Doctrine, (by reaſon of the nature of its principles) bringeth no Children unto glory,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:66021:56"/>are not the Lords fig-trees: but are like brambles, thorns and thiſtles, that ſcratch and prick the Church, but bring forth nothing that is ſweet and pleaſant, <hi>theſe ſerve for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to be cut down and caſt into the fire.</hi>

<note place="margin">

If once we had but taſted the fruit of the vine and of the fig-tree; and did right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know the uſe thereof, we would not part with it for all the pleaſures under the Sun.</p>
                  <p>Although the grapes be not fully ripe, we muſt not be diſmayed, and the figs but green and ſmall, yet the Lord taketh pleaſure in them; and counteth our poor beginnings to be tokens of the ſpring. If we humble our ſelves before him for our frailties and weakneſſes, and aske him forgiveneſs for the ſame, he looks upon us with gracious eyes and telleth us that Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is come. When we are aſhamed of our fruit, and begin to be diſmayed and hang down our heads like a bullruſh; yet then doth he ſpeake friendly and comfortable words unto us, as appeareth in the words next following.</p>

                  <p>Now in that he calleth again, it ſheweth how untractable the Soul is to come out of her miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and affliction, ſo wicked a thing is unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, which ſetteth nothing before our eyes in the time of tribulation, but only this that God hath no reſpect unto us; but that he is about wholly to caſt us of. Now becauſe there is no cure for unbelief but only faith, and faith can have no footing but only from truth; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our beloved in theſe words openeth his good heart unto us, and telleth us the very truth that we are his love, his fair one.</p>
                  <p>He that can make uſe of theſe words in time of Temptation, and can perſwade himſelf that they are ſpoken unto him, ſetting himſelf to prayer in good earneſt; for the eſtabliſhing of this very truth in his Soul, ſhall eaſily overcome his unbelief, and experimentally feel the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of faith.</p>
                  <p>And alſo Chriſt here declareth unto us, how willing he is that we ſhould receive him. He ſpeaketh not one word of diſcomfort to the afflicted Conſcience, as <hi>Satan</hi> by his inſtruments

                     <hi>The Rock is Chriſt.</hi> But then the Rock muſt open and divide, elſe how can there be a cleft for the dove to get in? Underſtand then by the cleft a right diviſion betwixt Chriſt and the Law, when the Conſcience is in diſtreſs; which diſtinction thou muſt learn to make by faith. For when the Law putteth thee in fear juſtly by reaſon of thy ſin, if thou humbleſt thy ſelf by faith thou killeſt the voice of the Law, and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:66021:58"/>makeſt the cleft: but if thou lookeſt upon the Law (in that time after thou haſt humbled thy ſelf and asked forgiveneſs) to be the voice of Chriſt, thou makeſt no cleft, thou canſt have no hiding place, to keep thee ſafe from fear. Make this account therefore with thy ſelf, that the Law is crucified, dead, and condemned unto thee, (in reſpect of the Conſcience) as ſoon as thou humbleſſ thy ſelf, and by faith layeſt hold upon Chriſt; then thou makeſt a right diviſion betwixt Chriſt and the Law, and hideſt thy ſelf in the cleft of the Rock ſo that if the Hawk, or other devouring fowls do wing after thee, to hanch upon thee; thou ſitteſt in ſafety from fear of evil, and it is but loſt labour for <hi>Satan,</hi> or any of his inſtruments to endeavour thy ruin.</p>
                  <p>For want of this knowledg many peoples hearts do ſhake, when they are like to be made a prey by ravenous Birds, and the Law and fear of Gods wrath begins to ſeize on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, they are even at their wits end, being wholly diſmayed.

But the bride of Chriſt that rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth theſe things, as ſhe preſumeth not upon her own worthineſs; So neither is ſhe diſmayed at her unworthyneſs, but ſitteth in the cleft of the Rock with <hi>Moſes,</hi>

                  <p>Theſe are ſaid to be ſecret places, becauſe the righteouſneſs of faith by which we aſcend to this communion, is ſecret and unknown to man's reaſon: for it conſiſteth in the deſtroying of the grounds of unbelief, which is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and root of all ſin, and the bane of all Chriſtian and holy duties.

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:66021:60"/>kind of righteouſneſs in the Church, is to take <hi>the foxes:</hi> for they <hi>ſpoil the vines.</hi> Some write of the foxes, that they make holes in the roots of the vines, and that by undermining the root; the root withers and the vine ſtarves. Others ſay that the fox having venemous teeth, faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his teeth in the rind of the vine, and ſo ſpoils the vines. And that ſometimes alſo by bruiſing the young ſprigs and ſhuts, they ſpoil the vines. But they that have vines, and are much troubled with foxes know beſt the truth of this. But this is certainly known that the fox loves grapes, and when they are ripe makes great ſpoil of them; and by ſpoiling the grapes doth much hurt to the vines.</p>
                  <p>By the foxes are principally meant falſe Prophets. <hi>Here O Iſrael thy Prophets are like the foxes in the deſerts.</hi>

                        <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.</note> And the injunction here is to take them. And the reaſon why they muſt be taken is, becauſe they ſpoil the vines, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fruit of the vines, the righteouſneſs of both Tables. And alſo becauſe the vines have tender grapes, meaning the young vines whoſe fruit is tender; and the fox being famous for ſubtilty, will endeavour to ſpoil thoſe firſt, chiefly if he grow to be a <hi>Reynald</hi> an old <hi>Fox,</hi> therefore the injunction here is to take the little foxes the young cubs, for they alſo ſpoil the vines. This charge is given by Chriſt, the perſons to whom, is to the Magiſtrate and Miniſter. The Miniſter is to diſcover the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:66021:60"/>foxes; and the Magiſtrate to puniſh them with the ſword.</p>
                  <p>Now that the foxes may be taken, their holes muſt be known, for the foxes have holes and in their holes they hide themſelves; and the firſt work the fox doth when he comes into the vineyard, is to make his hole, now the foxes hole is the righteouſneſs of the Law; he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolleth the righteouſneſs of works far beyond the righteouſneſs of faith; this he makes a great ſhew of, preſſeth very earneſtly and ſeems to walk in very ſtrictly, that ſo if any fault be found with his Doctrine, he may cover it and hide it under the character of an honeſt man. So that his firſt and principal work in ſpoiling the vines, is to deſtroy the righteouſneſs of both Tables; under a pretence of requiring ſtrictneſs and holineſs of life Therefore mark it,
<note place="margin">By the firſt principle in Doctrine underſtand the firſt ground, that is, layed to encourage thee to be lieve in Chriſt.</note> that when ever the fox cometh whether it be an old Reynald or a young Cub, by the firſt principles of his Doctrine, he magnifieth and extolleth a ſuppoſed righteouſneſs in man; far beyond the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, and by ſo doing he ſtrengtheneth in man a more honourable opinion of himſelf; then of the works and righteouſneſs of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: and ſo he taketh away and ſpoileth the righteouſneſs of the firſt Table, which is faith in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Next he alſo ſpoils the righteouſneſs of the ſecond Table, which is true love towards men, for the root and foundation of love towards
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:66021:61"/>men; is Gods love towards us apprehended by faith, for no man can exerciſe himſelf in ſhewing true love towards men, until his own heart be firſt warmed with the apprehenſion of Gods love towards himſelf, which the fox by his ſubtilty wholly deſtroyeth, for where the root and foundation of charity is plucked up; there charity which is the fruit muſt needs be blaſted and wither away. And thus the foxes ſpoil the vines. And this is the meaning of Chriſt when he ſays,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat:</hi> 7.</note> 
                     <hi>by their fruits ye ſhall know them,</hi> meaning ſuch fruits as ſpring from the principles of their Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Now when the foxes hole is known, the fox is taken, for then he is diſcovered to all to be the fox. Therefore if thou wilt hunt the fox, ſo as to take him, be ſure to drive him into his hole; for there he lurketh, and there thou ſhalt be ſure of him. All people that pertain to the vineyard ought to be careful in this thing: eſpecially thoſe that watch for Souls; for the fox cometh not in jeſt, but to ſpoil vines, to eat and conſume the tender grapes: to deſtroy the righteouſneſs of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that no man may have Salvation by him. And is it not time then for every man to look about him? It is not for nothing that ſo ſtrict a charge (as puniſhment by death) is given in <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. <hi>againſt thoſe that ſpeak in the name of other Gods.</hi>

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:66021:61"/>down God out of his Throne; or the fox by ſubtilty, let every man put to his ſhoulder, that they may be taken and deſtroyed. The lamentable miſery that is fallen upon us for want of care herein, is found by woful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</p>

                  <p>This breedeth a wonderful temptation in the godly, and is the greateſt tryal of faith that may be, when in ſtead of ſhewing pity and compaſſion, the enemy ſhall laugh and cry aha, this is the day that we looked for, lo we have ſeen it. Theſe be the watchmen that found the poor Church in this condition; which in ſtead of miniſtring any comfort to her in her diſtreſs, did add affliction to the afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>Theſe watchmen muſt we expect to meet with, who in ſtead of comforting, will uſe all means to hinder us from help and ſuccour; by caſting us into reproach and covering us with contempt, yet we muſt not be one jot diſmayed, but pray with <hi>David,</hi> Lord reſcue my Soul from
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:66021:66"/>their deſtructions. For although they hold a Councel together, whiſper, and make bold to propoſe the time of our downfal and utter ruin, yet ſhall the promiſe of God prevent them all: for it was but a little that the Bride paſſed from theſe, but ſhe found him whom her Soul loved. But mark here what ſhe ſaid to theſe watchmen.</p>
                  <q>—To whom I ſaid, ſaw ye him whom my Soul loveth?</q>
                  <p>It <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> not ſaid here, that the watchmen ſaid any thing to the Bride, yet in <hi>Song</hi> 5.7. 'Tis ſaid, they ſmote her and wounded her, that is, behind her back, with reproachful words, and diſgraceful terms.</p>
                  <p>This ſhews what manner of people the watchmen here ſpoken of were, ſuch as could belch out with their mouths; and had ſwords in their lips to ſlay the upright in heart: but this their miſchief was not open, but privily and ſecretly done? But what doth the Bride ſay to theſe watchmen? To whom ſhe ſaid, <hi>ſaw ye him whom my Soul loveth?</hi> Which is not to be underſtood ſo much of any private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, as by her ſpeaking to them in the Miniſtery when ſhe came into the ſanctuary of God. For the watchmen reproach the Church becauſe of her ſins and afflictions, and will ſcarcely afford her the title of bride; becauſe of her ſtains and blemiſhes: therefore the bride
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:66021:67"/>telleth them here they ſin againſt the Goſpel, and ſhe dealeth very plainly, ye never ſaw him whom my Soul loveth. The Goſpel breedeth in men pity and compaſſion, a willingneſs to think the beſt, to ſpeak the beſt of all men, to cover and hide tranſgreſſions to help thoſe that are in diſtreſs and miſery: theſe things the watchmen never learn'd, and being in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity themſelves they ſpeak loftily, and their tongues walk through the earth. Therefore ſhe telleth them this. Ye have no knowledg of Chriſt, ye never ſaw him whom my Soul loveth.</p>
                  <p>So that although theſe watchmen of <hi>Satan</hi> are high and lofty in their own eyes, and having more then heart can wiſh, do Lord it (out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly) over the bride, yet in the ſanctuary of God ſhe declareth their end, ſhe caſteth them down into deſolation and utter deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. After the ſame manner muſt we alſo learn to overcome the watchmen, even by making a right application of the word of God againſt them, before which they cannot ſtand: and alſo by comforting our ſelves through faith in Chriſt, againſt what they publiſhed of us in the ſtreets, then although they may ſeem to carry it over us outwardly before men, yet ſhall we inwardly reign over them through faith in Chriſt, who muſt reign in his members, till he hath put all his enemies under his feet.</p>

                  <p>THis paſſing from the watchmen is the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming of that temptation, which the bride fell into, by reaſon of their ſmitings with the tongue, in reſpect of her name and reputation. This ſeemeth to be the laſt temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in her ſad condition, which fell upon her immediately before deliverance came; for it was but a little time after ſhe paſſed from them, but <hi>ſhe found him whom her Soul loved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>She was not diſmayed at that bitter and heavy croſs, but ſtill continued ſeeking for help and deliverance: and at length ſhe found him <hi>whom her Soul loved,</hi> that is, <hi>ſhe found him</hi> createing help and deliverance, by ſuch ways and means, as ſhe never thought on, nor expected. And thus ſhall it aſſuredly come to paſs, for all thoſe that put their truſt in Chriſt, all things ſhall come to paſs where nothing is ſeen. And when <hi>Satan</hi> and all his inſtruments have done what they can, then ſhall the power of Chriſt appear above them all.</p>
                  <p>Therefore faith is a moſt victorious thing, that hath all the attributes of God knit faſt unto it, that it is as poſſible for God to become
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:66021:68"/>no God, as it is for any thing to be wanting, where faith is uſed. But firſt we muſt ſuffer a tryal, not being offended but rejoycing in the croſs: then ſhall we find by experience, that faith is no idle quality in the Soul, but a certain kind of Divinity within us, which cleaveth faſt unto God; and obtaineth help and ſuccour from him.</p>
                  <p>Moreover this is to be noted, that in the midſt of this bitter and heavy temptation, ſhe calleth Chriſt ſtill, <hi>he whom her Soul loveth;</hi> which cometh from a perſwaſion of Chriſts love to her, otherwiſe it could not be. This aſſurance ariſeth from faith, learn we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Doctrine, which breedeth and feedeth faith, then ſhall we alſo love God, and be fill'd with all Divine and Heavenly qualities. Now the bride having found her beloved, mark what ſhe did.</p>
                  <q>—I held him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him into my mothers houſe, and into the chamber of her that conceived me.</q>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>ſhe held him,</hi> ſhe laid up thoſe expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences of his merciful deliverances faſt in her mind and memory, and would not loſe them, nor yet declare them before ſcoffers and ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, (that contemn the word and ways of God) but to thoſe of her Mothers houſe,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:66021:68"/>(meaning the Church of God) by whoſe Doctrine ſhe was regenerated and brought up in the faith of Chriſt: to her brethren and ſiſters there, thither ſhe brought her beloved, <hi>and not only into her mothers houſe, but alſo into the Chamber where ſhe was conceived,</hi> meaning the Conſcience, to which Chriſt muſt be made known, where ever the knowledg of him comes to be effectual. She is not contented that the knowledg of him ſhould be ſetled only in the head, but alſo in the hearts of others, therefore ſhe bringeth Chriſt into the very Chamber, and cannot be ſatisfied until he be there.</p>
                  <p>Which ſheweth us the true nature of faith where ever it is, which is never to reſt ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied, until Chriſt be brought into the Conſcience, it is not at quiet but in performing the ſame office for others (after a certain manner) that Chriſt hath done for us, that even as Chriſt is become bountiful and beneficial to us, ſo alſo it ſtudieth which way to be bountiful and beneficial to all men, firſt to the Soul, and then to the body. Firſt, by teaching the Doctrine of Chriſt aright, next by teaching the Doctrine of good works, (and this is rightly to bring Chriſt into our mothers houſe) works cannot breed faith: faith cannot but breed good works. Therefore when good works are required, the Goſpel muſt go before, which muſt deliver and free the Conſcience from the guilt of ſin and wrath of God; and work in it

Into this wilderneſs the Church is brought, where ſhe findeth nothing but <hi>vanity and vexation of ſpirit:</hi> therefore Chriſt here ſetteth her out by way of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who is this that cometh out of the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs? That mounteth up above the world, and pineth not away in a ſad condition? For according to the wiſdom of the fleſh, there is no man under Heaven knoweth which way to get out: but the Church by faith in Chriſt cometh out, which is a ſervice highly accepted in the ſight of God, and which alſo preſerveth the Soul from ſinking in the day of adverſity, for when a man ſeeth others in proſperity, and himſelf in affliction, others to be highly eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and magnified for their outward pomp, and he himſelf to be incontempt, man is ready to judg ſuch perſons to be beloved of God, and he himſelf to be hated; but faith joineth
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:66021:70"/>us to the words of Chriſt in this place, who doth not as the world do, praiſe and extol thoſe that are high, honourable, and proſperous therein, but ſetteth out by words of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thoſe that do not faint in a ſad condition. What wonderful excellent creature is this, that doth not languiſh and pine away in her affliction? Which words muſt comfort us in an evil time, and cauſe us to rejoyce, and ſleep merrily in the woods through faith; although according to the fleſh and reaſon, we ſee not which way to get out.</p>
                  <p>And it is ſaid, ſhe cometh out like <hi>pillars of ſmoke.</hi> Some write that the Artificers in <hi>Egypt</hi> could by their Art make ſmoke to aſſend direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upright, <hi>like unto a pillar,</hi> and that the ſpirit of God may here have an alluſion to that ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude. But whether that be ſo or not we know this to be true, that ſmoke is offenſive to the eyes: now as ſmoke is troubleſome to the eyes, that they cannot behold things aright; So is the Churches faith <hi>(by which ſhe cometh out of her afflictions)</hi> offenſive to the wicked, darkneth their ſight that they cannot behold the inward glory of the Church: nor yet how ſhe cometh out of her afflictions. Faith is like the cloudy pillar, which gave light to the Children of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> but was darkneſs to the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> The godly ſtand upright in all their tribulations, when others hang down their head like a bullruſh. The Church under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth well enough how ſhe cometh out of
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:66021:70"/>her afflictions: but they that know not what the life and exerciſe of true faith is, cannot underſtand. Therefore the bride cometh out like pillars of ſmoke. Alſo ſome write that there is an Art in ſome, (with the uſe of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain powders) to perfume ſmoke; but this we are certain of,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3.</note> that the ſmoke of the incenſe in the golden cenſer, which is offered with the prayers of all the Saints, aſcendeth up before God, and perfumeth the Church.</p>
                  <p>Therefore when thou art in the wilderneſs, and haſt loſt thy way there, meeteſt with the wild-beaſts; by which thou art in danger to be made a prey, be not tormented nor diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but remember who brought thee in: <hi>the Lord thy God led thee into the wilderneſs,</hi>

                        <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.2.</note> he did not hurl or throw thee as having no care of thee, but lovingly took thee by the hand and led thee, to ſhew thee the great and terrible wilderneſs, before thou comeſt to <hi>Canaan</hi> the promiſed Land.

                     <hi>let thy prayers aſcend up as incenſe before God:</hi> then although thou art in the wilderneſs (for a little while) in reſpect of the body, yet thou art in Heaven in reſpect of thy faith. And ſhalt alſo come out of the wilderneſs, not only dazling the eyes of the wicked, who know nothing of the uſe and practiſe of faith: but alſo ſweet, being perfum'd with heavenly pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as here it follows.</p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:66021:71"/>
                  <q>—Perfumed with myrrhe and frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incenſe, and with all powders of the Merchant?</q>
                  <p>The Merchant that hath the powders is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. As Merchants bring pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders which make excellent perfumes: So the Lord Jeſus Chriſt with his excellent perfumes, ſweetneth all thoſe that come unto him.
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.32, 37.</note> Myrrhe was uſed in making the holy annointing oyl, to make perſons holy. And frankincenſe in making the ſweet perfume to ſmell thereto, which oyl and ſweet perfume was holineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord; to all thoſe that were perfum'd therewith. Now as Myrrhe and Frankincenſe, mixed with other excellent ſpices, being made a perfume, a confection, after the Art of the Apothecary, made perſons outwardly holy; So doth the righteouſneſs of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, where it is received by faith, make perſons holy before God, freeing them from the guilt of ſin, and everlaſting condemnation. Now mark we the time here when the bride is thus perfum'd, it is when ſhe is in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: for ſhe cometh out thence perfum'd, who is this that cometh out of the wilderneſs perfum'd? Which muſt teach us what is firſt to be done, when we are led into the wilderneſs; even ſo to order our ſelves, that we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:66021:71"/>this Heavenly perfume. They that take offence at the croſs, cannot receive the perfume. But why ſhould any one be offended; ſeeing it is for no other end and purpoſe, but that by receiving the Heavenly powders; we might be ſenſible of our holineſs in the ſight of God.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, when we are brought into the wilderneſs, made to ſit in the deſert and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary place, and all hope faileth us (in reſpect of reaſon) how or which way deliverance ſhall come: then if we can lift up our eyes and heart to our Redeemer with an aſſured faith, we ſhall on a ſuddain be altogether be cenſed with theſe Heavenly powders, and made to pertake of all that the Merchant hath to beſtow, the ſmell of which powders ſhould more refreſh and comfort us, then the fear of any danger ſhould poſſibly diſmay us.</p>

                  <p>Beſides, they are not only valiant men, but men that are armed, they all hold Swords; they do not run fooliſhly into the field, but before they enter into the combate, are ſure of their weapons, and alſo how to uſe them, for they are men expert in War, they know
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:66021:73"/>the bottom and foundation of all controverſy in the Church, and wherein the ſtrength of all arguments lie: theſe are faſt fellows that will not be bafled, but will ſtand their ground: <hi>every man hath his Sword upon his thigh,</hi> the word of God in a readineſs, they are ready to ſtrike, and they draw not the Sword in vain, but man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſet about the work; to deſtroy the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the wiſe, and to bring to nothing the underſtanding of the prudent, and this is their principal work.</p>
                  <p>For there is no enmity in all the world (the caſe being rightly underſtood) but about the Goſpel, neither is there any enmity betwixt God and us but about the Goſpel. Deſtroy by the Goſpel but the wiſdom and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in man: and we have peace in Heaven, and peace on earth. For go into what Nation, City, Family or Tribe, ſo ever thou wilt, and wiſely enquire into this matter, and thou ſhalt find that the cauſe of all diviſions what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, both in matters of Religion, and civil differences lyeth in this one thing, becauſe mans <hi>(opinion of his own)</hi> wiſdom and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs reigneth.</p>
                  <p>Therefore men are fill'd with complaints one againſt another, but no man complaineth againſt himſelf: which maketh it manifeſt that all men have an high conceit of their own wiſdom, and goodneſs, prizing of themſelves at an higher rate then all the world. For their opinion of themſelves is ſo great, that all
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:66021:74"/>men muſt ſtoop unto it, worſhip and adore it.</p>
                  <p>And ſo alſo in matters of Religion, this opinion is ſo ſtrong and mighty, that it will not endure to hear; that any man ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade himſelf, that the righteouſneſs of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is given to him, unleſs he firſt find in himſelf ſuch qualifications as <hi>(in his opinion)</hi> make him worthy of the ſame. Now becauſe this opinion in man fighteth directly againſt the Goſpel, <hi>(which forbideth it in the firſt place)</hi> it being the only ſin that defileth the bed, and which baniſheth Chriſt out of the mind and Conſcience: therefore againſt this opinion <hi>(that man hath of his wiſdom)</hi> do every one of theſe valiant ones ſet themſelves, and uſe all their heavenly skill and cunning to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the ſame, as being the ſtrongeſt hold of <hi>Satans</hi> Kingdom. And this they do for this reaſon, <hi>becauſe of fear in the night.</hi> This is the work of theſe valiant men, to baniſh <hi>(by their Doctrine)</hi> the fear of Gods wrath and everlaſting damnation, out of the mind and Conſcience: and to ſettle it in peace and joy. That when a man is in a dark and ſad condition <hi>(in the night of affliction)</hi> by reaſon of his ſin, the forerunner of fear and fearfulneſs; he might learn to remove and overcome his fear, by a right underſtanding and application of the Goſpel. No man being able to overcome his fear by the righteouſneſs of the Law, and his own works: but by cleaving to the promiſe of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:66021:74"/>God by faith without the Law. Therefore if thou wilt be one of the number of theſe valiant men, learn thou rightly how to guard King <hi>Solomons</hi> bed, how to diſpoſſeſs the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of fear: that Chriſt may lodge in the chamber with his bride, otherwiſe thou art not fit to be of the guard. Learn thou therefore to be expert in handling thy weapons to this purpoſe: for the pulling down of ſtrong holds, and the caſting down of imaginations, that every thought may be brought into captivity to the obedience of Chriſt.
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 10.4, 5.</note> If thy Doctrine ſetteth up ſtrong holds in man, and raiſeth up mans imaginations of himſelf; then thou ſoweſt in the heart the principles of fear, but if by thy Doctrine thou pulleſt them down, then thou baniſheſt fear.</p>
                  <p>If thou thinkeſt by an outward reformation to be poſſeſſed of Chriſt, and to baniſh fear; in ſtead of baniſhing fear, thou wilt baniſh Chriſt, for as much as that very opinion in thee crucifieth the ſon of God, that bed being to ſhort and the covering to narrow,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſa.</hi> 28.20.</note> to wrap thy ſelf in from the wrath of God.</p>
                  <p>Learn therefore to be skilful and very cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in this point. If thou groundeſt thy faith upon the Law, thou utterly loſeſt Chriſt; but if thy faith be formed by the Goſpel without the Law, then ſhalt thou have righteouſneſs, peace, and joy in the holy Ghoſt. Then ſhall thy faith be undefiled, and the marriage bed preſerved pure. Then ſhalt thou be of the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:66021:75"/>number of the threeſcore valiant men ſpoken of in this place that all hold Swords <hi>becauſe of fear in the night.</hi>

                     </label> ſheweth plainly, that the chief and principal thing, that is needful in the building of the Church of God, is the right underſtanding of the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>For it muſt be built with Silver and Gold, and if you conſult with <hi>Eſai.</hi> 54. with precious ſtones alſo, all which ſignifie, the pure Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel. Which building cannot go forward, without a right underſtanding of the Scriptures. The Silver pillars can never be made, the golden bottom can never be laid, the Church can never be covered with the purple covering, the righteouſneſs of the Lord
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:66021:76"/>Jeſus Chriſt: if there be not a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Scriptures taught.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that are builders of the Lords Chariot, and underſtand not the Scriptures; in ſtead of making Silver pillars, and laying the golden bottom, they lay a foundation of wood and traſh. In ſtead of building with Gold and Silver and precious ſtones, which will not decay; they build with timber, hay, and ſtubble, which will rot and conſume. And hence it comes to paſs, that in ſtead of cloathing the diſtreſſed Conſcience with the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and paving the way for the Soul to come to Chriſt, and making of thoſe Scriptures eaſy to be underſtood, which ſeem to ſtand in direct oppoſition to faith: it ſo falls out that the way to juſtification and life ſeems to be crooked, rough, and unpaved even to the builders them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſo that in the midſt of their work they are many times at a ſtand, and in ſtead of build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, fall at difference amongſt themſelves; ſome build for Chriſt, and others build for Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt; and all this comes to paſs for want of a right underſtanding of the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>Not that there is a neceſſity of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of all Scripture in building the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot: but of the principal parts of the word, ſuch as are eſſential to a mans being, and living in the ſtate of grace.</p>
                  <p>Such Scriptures as concern the Doctrine of juſtification and life Eternal, <hi>(without the works and righteouſneſs of man)</hi> and of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:66021:77"/>of the Soul under the ſight and feeling of ſin, and the apprehenſion of mercy, by which Doctrine only the Church is built. And there are two principal parts in the Scripture, the Law and the promiſe both which in reſpect of their uſe and office, are of great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Some when they make uſe of the Law do ſo interpret it, that they take away the glory of mans Salvation from God, and give it to men; theſe interpret without a rule, and for want of the rule to underſtand the Scripture by, which is the Divine Teſtimony of the holy Ghoſt, their building falls, and all their labour is loſt. For all Scripture is given by Divine inſpiration: therefore ſeeing the holy Ghoſt is the inditer, he ought alſo to be the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter. No Scripture being of any private interpretation from which it follows, that he that will be ſure that the ſence which he giveth is right; muſt have his authority from the holy Ghoſt, to warrant his expoſition to be true. To believe as the Church believes is not the rule to underſtand the Scriptures by, for the Church may erre, and when ſhe erreth from the publick interpretation of the holy Ghoſt, her interpretation is private, and not to be received.</p>
                  <p>Now as in all Arts and Sciences, the firſt principles are proving, and not to be proved, ſo in the Scriptures. And as the firſt principle in Divinity is the Scripture: So the firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in the Scripture is the firſt Commandment.

                  <p>IN which words the Holy Ghoſt directeth the Daughter of <hi>Zion,</hi> to a right behaviour of Soul, in receiving that Doctrine, wherewith the Chariot is made, which is to <hi>go forth and behold.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By which words he rightly teacheth, what the righteouſneſs of the Goſpel is; not to reſt in our ſelves, but by faith to behold King <hi>Solomon</hi> with his Crown. And alſo how the righteouſneſs of Chriſt ſhall be received and kept: even by going forth from depending
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:66021:80"/>upon our own inherent righteouſneſs. Theſe are the two moſt Excellent and moſt uſeful points above all others, and ought above all things to be preferred. Which Doctrine we rightly learn, when we ſubmit our ſelves to the comdemnation of the Law; and ſuffer our ſelves by faith, to be divorced from the Law. Elſe what doth it avail us to hear, that the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt is ever ſo excellent a thing; if we be not inſtructed by the Goſpel how to be divorced from our own. Now in this thing Chriſt differeth from all Teachers, for the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of man Teacheth after this ſort, if thou wilt attain to faith in Chriſt, and be aſſured thereof, do the Law, <hi>keep the Commandments of God:</hi> but the wiſdom of the Holy Ghoſt ſaith the clean contrary, <hi>go forth and behold King Solomon with his Crown.</hi> For this Act of faith in going forth to behold, is not to do the Law; but wholly to depart from the Law. So that rightly to behold King <hi>Solomon</hi> with his Crown; is wholly to forget and loſe the Law.</p>
                  <p>This place therefore teacheth us, how the righteouſneſs of the Ten Commandments may be attained, not by our doing the works of the Law; but by faith in Chriſt without the Law. Even by beholding the Kingdom and victory of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt to be given to us freely. This matter concerneth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and therefore it had need be well learned. Therefore when thou feeleſt thy ſin,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:66021:81"/>and feareſt the wrath to come, confeſs it to God; and ask forgiveneſs for Chriſts ſake with a believing heart; then haſt thou ſpiritually fulfill'd the Law, foraſmuch as the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt is given to thee, as ſoon as thou feeleſt and confeſſeſt thy condemnation by the Law; which thing thou oughteſt to beleive, it being the chief Corner-Stone in building the Kingdom of Chriſt in thy diſtreſſed Conſcience. Therefore who ever thou art that wouldeſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to righteouſneſs before God, and alſo to true peace and comfort in thy Conſcience, learn thou the way how to attain the ſame: even by faith in Chriſt without the works of the Law, to go forth and behold King <hi>Solomon</hi> with his Crown.</p>
                  <p>Now the Crown betokeneth the victory that Chriſt hath gotten over the Law,

                  <p>And it is further added here, the Crown wherewith his Mother Crowned him; by which is meant the Church. And by Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him the right preaching of the Goſpel, and alſo receiving of the ſame.
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.26.</note> For even as <hi>Batſheba</hi> the Mother of <hi>Solomon,</hi> became in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental for the ſetting of King <hi>Solomon</hi> on his Regal Throne:
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Kings.</hi>
                     </note> So doth the Church which is the Mother of us all become inſtrumental; in the Crowning of Chriſt by the Preaching of the Goſpel. Now Chriſt is Crowned by his Mother, when ſhe ſo interpreteth the Law,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:66021:81"/>that ſhe taketh away all glory from man; and attributeth the praiſe of her Salvation to Chriſt alone. In the Crowning of Chriſt; ſhe afflicteth her Children with the feeling of ſin by the Law; and comforteth them again with the Crown and victory of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt without the Law.</p>
                  <p>

                        <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.</note> Crowneth Chriſt in words, calling him her Lord, King, and Law-giver: but by her practice ſhe denyeth him. For ſhe ſo interpreteth all thoſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that are branches of the Law; that ſhe draweth the Law into the Doctrine of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                  <p>Thus ſhe taketh off the Crown, from Chriſts head,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.</note> who is Crowned with Glory and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; and putteth upon his head a Crown of Thornes.</p>
                  <p>There is a two fold Crowning of Chriſt in Scripture by his Father, and by his Mother. The firſt was at his Reſurrection,
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Acts</hi> 36.</note> when he was declared to be Lord and Chriſt, that was by his Father; the ſecond, when the benefits of his death and Reſurrection, are infuſed into the Conſciences of men by the Preaching of the Goſpel, this is done by his Mother. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are not only to behold him Crowned by the Father, although that we muſt do firſt; but alſo to learn the true way of Crowning him as the Mother, that he alone may reign in the heart and Conſcience. This is the day of the gladneſs of Chriſts heart, it being the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:66021:82"/>day of his eſpouſals: when he marrieth us unto himſelf in an everlaſting Covenant; and rejoyceth in us, and over us as the Bridegroom rejoyceth over the Bride.</p>
                  <p>Now when we have learn'd by faith to be ſeparated from the Law, and to go forth and behold King <hi>Solomon</hi> with his Crown; then muſt we come into the practice of the Law, which is to go forth and behold him in his afflicted members, to help thoſe that are in miſery;
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.8.</note> to comfort all that are in diſtreſs. Thus all that have believed in God muſt be careful to maintain good works, which are good and profitable unto men.</p>
                  <p>So that although the Goſpel divorceth us from the Law, in the matter of juſtification; yet, it joyneth us to the matter of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and cauſeth us to do that freely for others, <hi>(according to our power)</hi> which our Lord Jeſus Chriſt out of his abundant kindneſs hath freely done for us.</p>
                  <p>For who can chooſe but ſhew kindneſs joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to his brother: that hath apprehended by faith the love of Chriſt towards himſelf? All works before the Goſpel is received are naught, becauſe they are not directed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men, but drawn into the judgment ſeat to make us righteous; but faith ſeparat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth works from the judgment ſeat, and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them towards our neighbour, and ſo it makes our works, good works.</p>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:66021:82"/>
                  <p>This wiſdom the world underſtandeth not, therefore it is Condemned for deſpiſing the Goſpel, which it will not be ſubject to. Let us learn therefore, to lay aſide our works when we come before God, that we may be juſtified by faith; and live in the practice of all good works before men, that we may want no qualification which the Goſpel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</p>

Such may be joined to the Societies of men: but they cannot be united to Chriſt, becauſe they want the neck which couples the Church to Chriſt. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing faith is our victory, by which we muſt overcome all the fiery darts of the Devil: it behoveth us to know the proper nature of it, and the right uſe of it, and alſo how to define it rightly in the time of Temptation, leſt other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in ſtead of conquering, we ſhould in the end be overthrown.</p>
                  <p>Moreover in that it is ſaid, there hang a thouſand bucklers thereon, it further ſheweth us, that faith is a moſt mighty ſhield; for even as King <hi>Davids</hi> Tower, built for an armory, was fortified with Spears, Shields, and Bucklers,
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cron.</hi> 23.9.</note> to ſtrengthen him againſt his corporal enemies: ſo faith, (whereſoever the uſe of it is rightly known) hath all things in it to defend us from our ſpiritual enemies, becauſe it knitteth us to all the power and protection that is in God. Therefore theſe Bucklers are ſaid to be, all ſhields of Mighty men, becauſe all that put
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:66021:87"/>upon them the ſhield of faith, are mighty to overcome themſelves, the world, and the Devil.</p>
                  <p>So that even as <hi>Davids</hi> Worthies, did hold ſtrongly with him,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cron.</hi> 11.10.</note> and with all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to make him King: ſo do all theſe mighty men by their Doctrine and faith, oppoſe the world, and the whole Kingdom of <hi>Satan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore, ſeeing faith is ſo great a Tower, hath ſo many Bucklers and Weapons of defence in it, and maketh ſuch mighty men in the Kingdom of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: we that dwell in this mighty fort, ſhould wonderfully rejoyce, and not eaſily be overcome, but ſet our ſelves againſt our ſelves, the world, and the whole Kingdom of Antichriſt; and learn through the power of this mighty ſhield, to make all our adverſaries whatſoever to tremble.</p>

                  <p>AS the Lord is the Father of many Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſo he alſo provideth a Mother for them. And ſhe hath breaſts by which ſhe nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:66021:87"/>them. It is not enough to have a Child, if there be nothing to feed it: for then, for want of nouriſhment the Child muſt die.</p>
                  <p>Some ſay, that by the breaſts are meant, the Old and New Teſtament; others ſay no, becauſe in <hi>Solomons</hi> time, the New Teſtament was not written. Others think the Miniſters of the word are the breaſts, becauſe they are termed Nurſes: but they cannot underſtand the number; why they ſhould be ſaid to be but two.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that by the breaſts underſtand the Old and New Teſtament, (or if you will, the Law and Goſpel) ſeem to be in the right, for the New Teſtament although it was not written in <hi>Solomons</hi> time, as we have it now; yet the Covenant of grace was underſtood then, and alſo pen'd by <hi>Solomon</hi> moſt ſweetly, as in this <hi>Canticle</hi> of <hi>Solomon</hi> doth appear.</p>
                  <p>The milk that cometh out of theſe breaſts, is conveyed into the Conſcience by the teats which pertain to the breaſts. The teats are the Miniſters and expounders of the Law and Goſpel, which are called, the teats of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe when they give the ſenſe of the word truly; faith is preſerved,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eze.</hi> 23.3.</note> and the Church is preſented a Virgin to Chriſt. But if the teats are corrupted, then the virginity of the Bride is deſtroyed: and the purity of faith is loſt. Therefore it is ſaid, in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Text, that when <hi>Aholah</hi> and <hi>Aholiab,</hi>
                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:66021:88"/>(<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Samaria</hi>) had committed whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in <hi>Egypt;</hi> there the breaſts were preſſed, and the teats of their virginity were bruiſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Theſe breaſts are ſaid to be twins,</hi> becauſe the knowledg of them are brought into the Soul both together. And alſo to be two, to ſhew that they are diſtinct: and alſo that the true Mother feedeth her Children with both the breaſts with equal reſpect. And being likened to <hi>Roes feeding among Lillies,</hi> it ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, not that <hi>Roes do eat Lillies,</hi> for of all things <hi>(as ſome write)</hi> they eat them not; but the goodneſs of the paſture where they feed. For as in our Land we know ground to be good for feeding, when we find ſome certain ſort of graſs in it: ſo in <hi>Jury</hi> they knew their ground to be good; when there were ſtore of Lillies growing in it. So that there is rich feeding where the milk of theſe breaſts is drawn out; which filleth all that taſt thereof, with heavenly and Divine conſolations.</p>
                  <p>Which ſheweth us the cauſe why the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Church prove ſo little, why they do not learn knowledg, nor underſtand Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; but in ſtead of growing in grace, they grow in error; the reaſon is, becauſe they are weaned from the Breaſts,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſa.</hi> 28.9.</note> they never find the teat. The milk of conſolation never comes into the Conſcience for the nouriſhment of the Soul, becauſe there is a ſtoppage in the teats, that will not ſuffer the ſenſe of the word to enter.</p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:66021:88"/>
                  <p>Therefore the breaſts are preſſed, begin to quar, and grow ſore; becauſe the teats are bruiſed, and do not perform their Office. And hence it comes to paſs, that although the Goſpel be infinitely full of comfort and joy, ſuch joy that eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, nor hath ever entred into the heart of man to conceive: yet becauſe the ſence is not given, that the Conſcience <hi>(which is like a ſilly Babe)</hi> may taſte, and make application thereof; the comfort is gone, the joy is loſt.</p>
                  <p>And as the ſtoppage in the teat is one cauſe, ſo alſo the waywarneſs in the Babe is another; that will not come near the breaſts to taſt of the milk, that although the breaſts be full, and the teat be put into the mouth of it, yet it will not ſuck by any means that can be uſed. Therefore the breaſts being forſaken, and the teat deſpiſed, in ſtead of proving, it grows to be a Dwarf: it falleth into incurable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, runneth up and down, from one Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician to another; and at length falleth down into Everlaſting death and condemnation.</p>
                  <p>Therefore ſeeing the paſture is ſo good, and the feeding ſo excellent, as to feed among <hi>Lillies:</hi> it is good for every man, ſo to learn to feed that he may grow thereby. The Nurſe muſt learn how to give the teat, and alſo the infant how to receive the teat: that both may grow to a manly ſtature in Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:66021:89"/>
                  <p>Some that are Nurſes will ſuckle but with one breaſt, they give the Goſpel, but deny the Law to be of any uſe at all to a believer: theſe are not Children of the true Mother, becauſe they loſe one of the Breaſts. Others do earneſtly require the works of the Law to be done, and give not the Goſpel, but upon condition of mans obedience to the ſame: theſe deſtroy the uſe of both the Breaſts. But the true Mother giveth both the breaſts, and ſo openeth and defineth both the Law and Goſpel, that every mean capacity may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it.</p>
                  <p>She conſidereth the condition of all her Children, and when ſhe findeth any in heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, ſhe ſuckleth them with the Goſpel; but thoſe that are hardned and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous, and think themſelves ſecure; She followeth them with the Law, to drive them to Chriſt. Therefore ſeeing the Breaſts are here commended, becauſe the Church is nouriſhed by them, and the Mother alſo in that ſhe giveth both the Breaſts; let every one in his place, learn ſo to give the Breaſt, and ſo to receive the milk, in the natural taſte of it, that the Conſcience having once caught the teat by faith, it may ſuck and be ſatisfied with Divine conſolations.</p>

                  <p>There are two great Mountains in man by reaſon of the fall. The one is the Mountain of preſumption, which ſtandeth in a falſe opinion of the Law: and is, by reaſon of the loſs of mans Spiritual wiſdom and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
                  <p>The other is the Mountain of diſpair, which ſtandeth in a falſe opinion of the Goſpel.

                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:66021:90"/>

                  <p>The one is the <hi>Mountain of Myrrhe,</hi> when he deſtroyeth in us our falſe opinion of the Law; the other is <hi>the hill of Frankincenſe,</hi> when he teacheth us rightly to define the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are ſweet and pleaſant hills, becauſe of the ſweet and heavenly Poſeys that are given unto us, in theſe deliverances; and this is the proper work and office of the Goſpel, and the foundation of love and all good works to men.

<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſa.</hi> 34.14.</note> and to what they are likened. The wild beaſts of the deſert, ſhall meet with
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:66021:92"/>the wild beaſts of the Iſland, they ſhall come out of one Country to another to hold up their meetings. And the <hi>Satyr</hi> ſhall cry to his fellow; a wild god of the wood, a creature of divers ſhapes.

                        <hi>Ver.</hi> 14.</note> And the <hi>Shrichowl</hi> ſhall reſt there alſo, whoſe voice is tun'd ſomething like a woman ſpeaker. Such as theſe a nation ſhall be fill'd with, when God will puniſh a people for the contempt of his word.

This is not meant of the natural <hi>Owl</hi> (as I conceive) but of ſome Spiritual Father that is a gatherer; that layeth ſtrange principles, and hatcheth up others in his own opinions.</p>
                  <p>Theſe ſorts of Creatures, (many of them) come from far, no man knows from whence; few or none of them uſe to haunt amongſt the Birds of Heaven, but uſe unhaunted and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accuſtomed places, and by a ſtrange confuſion of Language; ſeek to undermine the faith of Chriſt. Therefore the Holy Ghoſt likeneth them here to wild beaſts, and their meetings to be but like the crying of <hi>Satyrs,</hi> (a kind of betwitching of little Children in the cradles) and the noiſe of <hi>Shrichowls,</hi> and their gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to be but as the laying and hatching of the <hi>Owl,</hi> the which nothing could be ſpoken of more contemptibly.</p>
                  <p>Now in that Chriſt calleth his Church to come from <hi>Lebanon, from Amana, from Shenir and Hermon;</hi> it ſheweth plainly, that where
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:66021:93"/>the Goſpel is taught, the Church muſt look to be peſtered with <hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>Seducers</hi> that ſhall oppoſe the ſame. There the <hi>Satyrs</hi> ſhall dance and walk in divers ſhapes ſeeking to bewitch thoſe that follow them.</p>
                  <p>Thither the wild beaſts ſhall come, who ſhall run head long upon all thoſe that ſhall op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them. There the <hi>Owls</hi> ſhall hold their Court and think by a ſtrange and an unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed noiſe to deſtroy all at once.</p>
                  <p>Now in regard Chriſt ſaith come with me from <hi>Lebanon,</hi> it ſheweth, that the victory over theſe Vermin, is not to be gotten by the Law, but by Chriſt. <hi>Sectaries</hi> and <hi>Seducers</hi> teach no other way to faith and Juſtification but by their own doings; therefore the Holy Ghoſt calleth them and their followers, an habitations of <hi>Dragons.</hi> Now in regard <hi>(by their principles)</hi> they ſeek juſtification by the Law:
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.2.</note> therefore they cannot be convicted by the Law; becauſe the Law requireth obedience upon the ſame terms.

                  <p>The firſt point of policy in the old <hi>Serpent</hi> the <hi>Devil</hi> was to corrupt <hi>Eve</hi> in her faith, which thing is alſo attempted by the whole Miniſtry of <hi>Satan.</hi> If therefore thou heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eneſt to that Doctrine, that by the principles
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:66021:93"/>of it, deſtroyeth faith in Chriſt: then thou art an inhabitant with the <hi>Dragon,</hi> and ſetled in the <hi>Owls</hi> neſt. Hearken we therefore to the voice of our beloved, which teacheth the active doing of the Law, in obtaining righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs before men: but gathereth all his ſheep into his fold, not by the Active, but by the Paſſive doing of the Law.</p>
                  <p>Therefore when thou heareſt from <hi>Amana,</hi> the active doing of the Law urged to bring thee to faith and juſtification: Look thou then from the top of <hi>Amana,</hi> and ſtedfaſtly believe the Goſpel; which teacheth no other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative to faith and juſtification, but the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive doing of the Law. If thou groundeſt thy faith there, then thou forſakeſt all the wild beaſts in <hi>Lebanon,</hi> and art ſeparated from <hi>Amana, Shenir,</hi> and <hi>Herman:</hi> thy being is no longer with <hi>Dragons,</hi> but thy Scituation is in <hi>Mount Sion;</hi> and the Lord is become thy habitation.</p>
                  <q>—From the Dens of Lions, from the Mountains of Leopards.</q>
                  <p>He calleth them <hi>Lions</hi> and <hi>Leopards</hi> becauſe falſe Prophets are deſtructive Creatures: all their Labour is to bring Souls to everlaſting ruin. And although they walk under the Title of Saints amongſt themſelves: yet the Holy Ghoſt calleth them the habitation of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:66021:94"/>
                     <hi>Devils,</hi> and a cage of every unclean and hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Bird.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Den</hi> of theſe <hi>Lions</hi> is, where men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their own doings beyond the Goſpel. Not when the Law is truly taught, but when it is ſtretcht beyond its bounds and limits; when man hath an high opinion of his works, an evident ſign whereof is, when the <hi>Publican</hi> is deſpiſed which maketh it appear, that the <hi>Phariſee</hi> which deſpiſeth him truſteth in his works.</p>
                  <p>This is <hi>the Lions Den,</hi> and in regard there are many ſuch people, and alſo ſuch Societies that flock together into <hi>Mountains and Dens:</hi> into obſcure places, and under a pretence of great zeal and holineſs do deſtroy the faith of ſome, and danger the Seducing of others; therefore the Holy Ghoſt termeth them, <hi>to Dens of Lions, and Mountains of Leopards;</hi> and calleth the Church from thoſe <hi>Dens and Mountains,</hi> becauſe no man can live there, but firſt or laſt he ſhall be made a prey.</p>
                  <p>Moreover <hi>Lions and Leopards</hi> may ſignifie wicked Rulers, which are fierce, cruel, and full of rage againſt the Church of God; and alſo thoſe of any ſort that plot and contrive, how to get power in their hands to work the ruin of the people of God.</p>
                  <p>Of ſuch <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.9, 10.</note> that lie in wait ſecretly as a <hi>Lion in his Den</hi> to catch the poor: that crouch and will not ſtir nor wag <hi>(but only
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:66021:94"/>caſt their eyes about)</hi> till they are certain of their prey, but as ſoon as the prey comes within their reach, they clap in their claws, and tear the poor in pieces. Theſe are like the <hi>Leopards</hi> alſo,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.23.</note> which are fierce Creatures and full of ſpots. And even as the <hi>Leopards</hi> may be known by their ſpots, ſo alſo may theſe be known, having ſpots that make them very diſcernable.</p>
                  <p>So that a man may eaſily find where the <hi>Leopard</hi> hath been by his ſpots, which ſpots he cannot change; but ſheweth them where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he maketh after his prey, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the utter ruin and deſtruction of the people of God. Now in regard Chriſt ſaith come with me, it ſheweth, that the <hi>ſpouſe</hi> is ſafe in his preſence; notwithſtanding theſe <hi>Lions and Leopards.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſeeing he ſaith, from the <hi>Dens,</hi> and from their <hi>Mountains;</hi> it ſheweth, that they are utterly diſowned by Chriſt, and left alone in the Kingdom of the <hi>Devil,</hi> where God will make uſe of them for a time for the afflicting of his Church: and afterwards will caſt them from their Mountains into Everlaſting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>THis is a note of admiration, which ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that Chriſts delight is in nothing, but that we love him, which love we ſhew when we believe his word, and endeavour by the ſame to throw down the Kingdom of the <hi>Devil.</hi> This is the only thing which maketh us beautiful in the ſight of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And when he addeth, <hi>my ſiſter, my ſpouſe,</hi> it comprehendeth all Divinity; ſetteth forth the nature of God to us, and the full ground of our faith. For ſeeing he ſaith, <hi>my ſiſter,</hi> he teacheth us, that he is really and truly our loving brother; that is naturally affected to us, careth for us in all conditions, and pityeth us in all diſtreſſes.</p>
                  <p>And ſeeing he ſaith <hi>my ſpouſe,</hi> he teacheth us that we are no longer twain but one. And
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:66021:96"/>doth thereby aſſure us, <hi>that he is bone of our bones, and fleſh of our fleſh:</hi> and that whatſoever he hath done and ſuffered, is ours as really and truly, as if we had done it in our own perſons.</p>
                  <p>Theſe words therefore are full of admirable conſolation, becauſe they aſſure us, that Chriſt came into the world on purpoſe to own us; to take all evils from us, and to beſtow all good things upon us. Which muſt alſo draw us into the uſe, and practiſe of our faith. For ſeeing he is our brother we ſhould not be afraid of him, but go unto him with boldneſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence. And ſeeing he is our Husband, we muſt be aſſured that he taketh from us the guilt of all our ſins, and diſchargeth us to his Father.</p>
                  <p>The conſideration of this muſt alſo help us in all croſſes and calamities: foraſmuch as he cannot ſuffer us to want any thing we ſtand in need of; if we ſtedfaſtly believe in him.</p>
                  <p>But it is curſed unbelief that cauſeth in us a ſlighting and contemning of the word, and therefore we loſe the good things we ſtand in need of; which otherwiſe we could not want.</p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:66021:96"/>
                  <q>—How much better is thy love then Wine!—</q>
                  <p>Which is as much as to ſay, I love thee far beyond all Creatures. Wine cheereth and rejoiceth the heart of man, but in that thou loveſt me with hearty affection; it is better to me then Wine is to any man. And when he ſaith, how much better! he teacheth us, that no Creature is able to ſet down the ſeveral dimenſions of his love, which paſſeth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Chriſt uſeth this paſſionate ſpeech to draw us to a good opinion of him, being written for no other purpoſe but that we might believe, for when he loveth us once, he loveth us to the end.</p>
                  <p>Theſe words therefore are chiefly to be made uſe of in times of diſtreſs, when the mind is perplexed with hard thoughts of God, when we look upon him as he is revealed in the Law: but not as he hath revealed himſelf in the Goſpel to the humbled ſinner, then are we principally to hear theſe words. For to this end Chriſt makes himſelf known to us by his word, that he might get himſelf a name in our hearts; and that we might get the victory over our unbelief. We muſt therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve theſe words, and then it ſhall be to us according to his word: but if otherwiſe we ſlight and contemn his word, he ſhall notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:66021:97"/>find an object of his love elſe where; but we ſhall be caſt off, forſaken and deſpiſed.</p>
                  <q>—And the ſmell of thine ointments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all ſpices.</q>
                  <p>Spices by the Law were to be uſed in making the ſweet ointments for the Tabernacle;
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.</note> and all the veſſels thereof. Which ointments had a moſt excellent ſmell: and did ſignifie the righteouſneſs of Chriſt inherent in himſelf. Which righteouſneſs of Chriſt when it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by faith, the ſpouſe is annointed with: and made to ſmell ſweet in the preſence of God. Theſe ointments being ſaid to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all ſpices, the righteouſneſs of Faith is beyond all righteouſneſs: becauſe it ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up an excellent perfume into the noſtrils of God.</p>
                  <p>And the reaſon why theſe ointments are ſo ſweet, is, becauſe they are compounded ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Art,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.23.</note> So that no ointments are like unto them. The ointment of the Tabernacle was made of <hi>principal ſpices:</hi> and alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded according to the Art of the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary. The ointment that ſweetneth the ſpouſe, is the righteouſneſs of God and man: no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound ſo excellent. So the perfuming ſpice for the Tabernacle, was a moſt rare confection, tempered together of moſt excellent ſpices pure and holy, and alſo was made according
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:66021:97"/>to Art; and therefore it is, that it was ſo excellent.</p>
                  <p>Which ſheweth us the reaſon, why there is ſo little ſweetneſs in the World, why men ſtink like carrion in a ditch, and leave a filthy ſavour behind them, in every place whereere they come, the reaſon is, becauſe they were never perfumed with theſe ſweet and holy oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. What profit were it in the ointments of the Sanctuary (although they were ever ſo ſweet a perfume) if none were annointed therewith? The righteouſneſs of Chriſt is a moſt excellent ſweet perfume, but what avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this at all, to thoſe that are not anointed therewith? To thoſe that ſmell it not, the pure <hi>Myrrhe</hi> and the <hi>Cinamon</hi> is but caſt away; the ſweet <hi>Calamus</hi> and the <hi>Caſſia</hi> is but troden under foot.</p>
                  <p>Therefore we muſt learn, in time of diſtreſs of mind, to ſmell to theſe ſweet and heavenly ointments: that when the ſtink of our ſins, do caſt an ugly favour before God, in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and in the ſight of the World; yet, that then, the ſcent of theſe holy ointments, may make us a pleaſant perfume.</p>
                  <p>Now as there was an Art in compounding theſe ointments:
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.33, 37.</note> ſo there is alſo an Art in ſmelling. And as there was no compound like unto it: ſo there was no other perfume that was to be ſmelt unto. Some there are that can ſmell no difference between theſe ointments, and the perfumes of their own compounding:
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:66021:98"/>theſe make not a confection after the Art of the Apothecary. And therefore it comes to paſs, that when they go about to annoint, the ſpiritual Tabernacle and his veſſels, the Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick and his veſſels, to make them moſt holy, that the Lord may delight to dwell amongſt them; by annointing them with perfumes of their own compounding, they leave them in their filthineſs, and under the curſe and Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting wrath of God. Therefore let us learn ſo to ſmell the heavenly perfume, that we may diſcern the ſmell thereof from all other oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: then ſhall our afflicted Conſciences find reſt in time of diſtreſs; then ſhall the ſmell of our ointments be beyond the ſmell of all ſpices.</p>

                  <p>And to a <hi>garden incloſed,</hi> becauſe ſhe is hedged or ſenced about with the promiſes of God, for the preventing of evil beaſts which otherwiſe would deſtroy her. Therefore, when the Bear cometh out of the wood, and with his paw thinketh to pull down the fence, and lay the Garden waſt: or the wild Boar out of the Forreſt with his tusk, thinketh to root up the hedg, and the Lions roar and make a hideous noiſe againſt it; we muſt be ſure to ſee, that we underſtand the Goſpel and Chriſtian righteouſneſs ſo well, that the hedg be not
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:66021:99"/>broken down thereby, but that the incloſure may ſtand firm and ſure.</p>
                  <p>And as we muſt look to the fence, ſo alſo we muſt ſee that the garden be well ſtor'd with all manner of precious Flowers, that the ſcent of the garden may be ſmelt: and that if any one ſhould deſire after a principal Flower, he may know where to find it. It were a ſad thing if a man ſhould come into a Garden, that hath a name above other Gardens; and ſhould deſire the Gardiner for a Poſey, and ſhould find little elſe there but common Flowers, or perhaps dead and withered Flowers. So that when <hi>(for the very name of the Garden)</hi> a man hath come very far, hath taken pains to ſearch into the Garden, and made him a Poſey of the choiceſt Flowers he can find: when he ſmelleth to his noſegay, the Flowers have loſt their ſcent.</p>
                  <p>This brings a kind of contempt upon the Garden, cauſing it to be of little eſteem: for when he compares his Poſey with the Flowers that grow in other Gardens, he findeth them far too ſhort both in beauty and ſmell.</p>
                  <p>When the Lord planted the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> a river went out of the garden to water the garden, and from thence it was parted into four heads, and ran into divers Lands: it ran into the Land of <hi>Havilah,</hi> into the Land of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> into the Land of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and the river <hi>Euphrates.</hi> The river that watered the Lords garden, was to water the whole Earth.
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:66021:100"/>The Flowers and herbs that are ſet and planted in the Lords garden, are to ſweeten the whole World.</p>
                  <p>Therefore ſeeing the Lord hath made us his garden, and fenced us with his hedg, let us learn ſo to ſtore it with rich and precious things: that if any man come to us and deſire a Poſey, we may ſhew him ſuch choice and principle flowers, that common gardens will not yield, even ſuch that will cauſe him to leave a ſcent, and caſt forth a perfume, in all places whitherſoever he goeth.</p>
                  <p>And when it is added here, <hi>my ſiſter, my ſpouſe,</hi> it is to draw all that are within the viſible Church to become the Lords garden of delight; Some gardens are for the kitching, wherein are planted only things for the belly, to feed the old man: and ſome are only for beauty and ſmell. Now Chriſt in drawing the Church to union with himſelf, to become his watered garden, when ſhe is once humbled for her ſins, mentioneth not one word of her infirmities, but mindeth her of the relations between them: that ſo by ſetting himſelf in her ſtead, he might draw her mind and cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, wholly to himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Which muſt well be noted of all Superiors, that have any Authority over others, and do deſire to win them to faith and obedience, which uſually take another courſe. Who (in ſtead of ſhewing any favour and acceptance to their relations, although they know them
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:66021:100"/>to be truly humbled for their faults) do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually complain of their diſobedience, and no wonder if they have cauſe ſo to do. For they ſeek not to draw them by any <hi>cords and bands of love:</hi> but to drive them to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by wrath and bitterneſs. Seldom or never taking any notice of what is done: but ſtill complain for want of what is not done. They hardly ever mention the beſt things that are in them, which are worthy of praiſe; but are always uncovering and laying open their frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and weakneſſes: and at ſuch times, and in ſuch places, as may tend moſt to their diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and diſgrace. And hence it comes to paſs, that in ſtead of winning their hearts and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to love and obedience: their countenance comes to be caſt down, and they are altogether heartleſs and heedleſs.</p>
                  <p>But Chriſt our Lord here giveth us another pattern, who skippeth over the worſt things that are worthy of blame in his Church: cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them all by giving himſelf unto her. Chriſt here ſpeaketh after this manner. Behold, <hi>thou art my ſiſter, I am thy loving brother,</hi> that do bear natural and hearty affection to thee. <hi>Thou art my ſpouſe,</hi> and I am thy loving Husband, I love thee with real and hearty affection. I take upon me all thy ſins and miſeries, that I might free thee from all diſtreſs: and do ſupply all thy wants that thou mighteſt live in peace and joy. And this I do on purpoſe to draw thy hearty love and affection to me, that thou
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:66021:101"/>mighteſt accept of my love, and confeſs my kindneſs, and ſerve me with a willing and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervice.</p>
                  <p>After this ſort muſt we learn alſo, to cover the faults of thoſe that are under our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, to hide their weakneſſes, to cover their faults, to bury their frailties, in love and kindneſs. Then ſhall we ſet our ſelves, not in the place of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who always chideth us for tranſgreſſions: but in the place of God, who mercifully forgiveth us our ſins, hideth and healeth all things that may diſcomfort and diſmay us.</p>
                  <p>By this means ſhall we unite their hearts to us, to love and obey us, to love and worſhip the ſame God, to be of the ſame faith, and the ſame Religion.</p>
                  <p>But why is the Church a ſpring ſhut up,
<label type="milestone">

                     </label> and a Fountain ſealed?</p>
                  <p>Not that ſhe is unwilling to beſtow or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the water of life:

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſ. </seg>
                     </label> for out of her belly is ſaid to flow rivers of living water:
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.</note> But becauſe the miſtery of her Doctrine, Faith, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, is ſhut up and ſealed from the blind world. For it is the wiſdom of God in a miſtery which none of the Princes of the world know.
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cro.</hi> 2.8.</note> So that the ſhutting up or hiding is in reſpect of thoſe that are loſt, that are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the faith, that are ſtrangers, and will be ſtrangers from the life of God.</p>
                  <p>Not becauſe of any unwillingneſs in the Church to communicate her Doctrine, nor by
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:66021:101"/>reaſon of any hardneſs in the Doctrine it ſelf; but by reaſon of that mighty oppoſition that is in man, which hindreth the underſtanding of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>This muſt comfort us to whom God hath given ſo great a treaſure, which is hid from others. And alſo learn us to uſe all care and diligence in opening of the ſpring, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſealing of the Fountain; that if it be poſſible the eyes of the blind may be enlightned, and the ears of the deaf may be opened, which cannot be done without the key of the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> which is, rightly to underſtand and open the Article of juſtification: the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal and critical point, upon which all true underſtanding doth depend.</p>
                  <p>Now there is a double uſe of a key, to lock and to unlock: if the dore be lock'd no man can ſee what is in the houſe; but when the dore is unlock'd, then all things may be ſeen. If the Article of Juſtification be unlock'd, and mans opinion of righteouſneſs by the Law deſtroyed, then the ſpring is opened, and the fountain is unſealed; then the waters of life do run freely to poor ſinners: but if man be ſtrengthened in his own opinion of works, by a falſe underſtanding of the Law, then the Fountain is ſealed, the ſpring is ſhut up, the water of life is not to be had.</p>

Then ſhall the bleſſed Fountain of life be opened and unſealed, that thoſe for whom it is provided may drink thereof, and live for ever.</p>

And to Pomegranates, becauſe they are full of kernels as the Pomegranates be: which are pleaſant to the taſte, and delightful to behold. In this Orchard there grows alſo <hi>Camphire</hi> which beareth fruit in cluſters, and <hi>Spikenard,</hi> which ſome think to be the herb call'd <hi>Lavender:</hi> and <hi>Saffron,</hi> all which are moſt excellent for ſweetneſs. Then here is <hi>Calamus</hi> and <hi>Cynamon,</hi> which were uſed in the compoſition of the holy annointing oyl, which made perſons holy.

                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.</note> as all things before-named, did ſet forth the ſweetneſs of the fruits of Chriſts death and Reſurrection being given to the miſerable diſtreſſed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Theſe are the fruits that grow in the Lords Orchard, which are ſhewen unto us under the ſimilitude of all thoſe ſweet and pleaſant things.</p>
                  <p>Now an Orchard doth not come to be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, by any thing done by the trees or plants that are ſet in it, but by reaſon of the ground wherein they are planted; which cauſeth them to grow and bloſom, by infuſing ſap and moiſture into the root. The plant is meerly Paſſive it only ſtandeth ſtill, and maketh no oppoſition, and receiveth the nouriſhment that cometh to it from the ground. The holy Ghoſt by this ſimilitude, ſheweth us, not only the fruitfulneſs of the Lords people;
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſa.</hi> 61.11.</note> but alſo the manner of their growth. For even as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den cauſeth the things that are ſowen in it to ſpring forth, So the Lord God will cauſe righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and praiſe to ſpring forth before the Nations. So the Lord will do it, that is, not by requiring the Active righteouſneſs of the Law firſt, for that is contrary to the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: but by infuſing the Paſſive righteouſneſs in the firſt place, which is, not to labour, not to take pains in doing the works of the Law;
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:66021:106"/>but to hear and believe the voice of the Son of God. The ſum of all is this.</p>
                  <p>That the ſpiritual plants in the Lords Church, do bring forth variety of excellent fruits, in regard they grow and bloſom, after the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of an Orchard.</p>
                  <p>And the cauſe why they grow after this manner is, becauſe the workmen in Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, do plant and graft after the ſame form. They do not plant and graft according to their own natural way of grafting: to make men holy by works, but in a way which is contrary to nature, to make them righteous by faith. Their buſineſs lies in compounding of oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to make perſons Holy. In ſprinkling perfuming ſpices, made after the Art of the Apothecary: that poor diſtreſſed conſciences may become fruitful in faith and all good works.</p>
                  <p>Another cauſe is, becauſe the plants them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are willing to become Paſſive after the manner of an Orchard. They are willing <hi>(when Gods time is come)</hi> to be cut out of that Olive tree which is wild by nature, and to be grafted contrary to nature into a right Olive tree. They are willing to be planted in Gods Orchard, where they muſt ſtand againſt every ſtorm, without fear of being ſhaken to pieces. So that although the winds blow, and the flouds come, and the trees are ſhaken at the very roots, yet they are willing to ſtand againſt every ſtorm, and after the ſimilitude of an
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:66021:107"/>Orchard, even then to receive the moiſture and nouriſhment that floweth from the Goſpel, which is the ground wherein they ſtand. Now becauſe the planters plant after this form, and alſo the plants themſelves are willing to yield and conform to the ſame way of planting and grafting; therefore it is that they are fill'd with ſweet and moſt excellent fruit, otherwiſe it could never be.</p>
                  <p>This ſheweth us the reaſon, why there are ſo many plants in Gods Orchard that grow not, ſo as to bring forth any manner of choice fruit ſuitable to ſuch an Orchard, the reaſon is, becauſe they grow not after the ſame ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
                  <p>They complain that they cannot maſter their ſins, nor perform their duties, that they have not that underſtanding in the Scriptures that others have: the reaſon is becauſe they are not planted nor grafted according to the right form. They work and toil, they labour and take pains, both the planters and the plants themſelves, to grow and increaſe in the opinion of works, but bring forth none of theſe ſweet and pleaſant fruits; becauſe they are not willing to be cut and hewen down, digg'd and prun'd, and dreſſed, after the ſimilitude of an Orchard. Therefore it is, that when ſtorms come they are not able to ſtand, when calamities ariſe they are not able to endure; but one runs one way, another runs another way, to look for help and ſuccour, becauſe they have not learn'd
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:66021:107"/>to ſtand and receive the ſap and moiſture of the Goſpel, (which is the ground from whence they grow) after the ſimilitude of an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard.</p>
                  <p>And hence it comes to paſs that in ſtead of bringing forth <hi>Camphire, Spiknard, and Saffron,</hi> which is ſweet and pleaſant fruit: they ſprout forth roots of bitterneſs, gall and wormwood. In ſtead of bearing the ſweet <hi>Calamus,</hi> and <hi>Cynamon,</hi> to make the holy annointing oyl, to make the ſpiritual Tabernacle and all the veſſels thereof holy before the Lord: and the ſweet <hi>Frankincenſe Myrrhe</hi> and <hi>Aloes</hi> to make a moſt holy and ſweet perfume; they ſend forth a noiſom fume of their own compounding, which cauſeth them moſt horribly to ſtink in the preſence of God. So that the end of their labour and pains is but this, the fruit which they think to be the only fruit that healeth the Nations, when it is rightly taſted, and the ſcent of it truly ſmelt, and compar'd with the fruits that grow in the Orchard of the Lord; it is found to be but of an evil ſavour, fruit that withereth, and comes to nothing. So long as it is look'd upon by it ſelf, the ſcent pleaſeth; but when it is compar'd with the ſweet Frankincenſe and other ſweet and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ſpices, which are prepar'd to perfume the ſpiritual Tabernacle of the Lord and every veſſel pertaining thereunto; it is found to be nothing elſe but meat that periſheth, fruit that withereth, and the trees themſelves that bear
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:66021:108"/>the fruit to be ſuch that are marked out, to be hewn down and caſt into everlaſting fire. According to our Saviours ſaying,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.</note> if a man abide not in me he is caſt forth as a branch; and is withered, and men caſt them into the fire and burn them. And every plant that my heavenly Father hath not planted ſhall be root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, ſeeing it is the commendation of the Church in this place, in that ſhe is like unto an Orchard of ſuch ſweet and pleaſant fruits, in that ſhe receiveth her ſelf, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth, and as an inſtrument conveyeth, the ſweet and pleaſant fruits of Chriſts death and Reſurrection, into the hearts and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of others, that they may be fill'd with all the chief ſpices, and be ſo becenſed and perfumed therewith, as to become a ſweet favour unto God in every place, let us alſo endeavour to be fill'd, with all theſe chief and principal ſpices, that we may know what to do in the time of tribulation and great diſtreſs, when we feel the terrors of the Almighty; and begin to be ſore afraid, when we can ſee no way nor means of deliverance, but the tree ſeems to be blaſted, and all hope of fruit to be loſt, yet then let us conſider, that we are plants in Gods Orchard, where we muſt ſtand againſt every ſtorm, ſo that although the winds blow, and ſtorms come and we are even ſhaken at the very roots; yet there muſt we ſtand and receive the ſap and nouriſhment of the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:66021:108"/>Goſpel; which ſpeaketh comfortable words to the miſerable Soul.</p>
                  <p>And not only ſo, but alſo that we may be able to anoint and perfume diſtreſſed minds, that a poor diſtreſſed Conſcience may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted by us in a ſad condition, that the cluſter of <hi>Camphire</hi> may appear in the Conſcience: <hi>that the ſcent of the Calamus and Cynamon may be ſmelt, and the Spikenard, Myrrhe and Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incenſe, may become as a Poſey to refreſh the ſpiritual ſenſes, under the apprehenſion of Sin and the wrath of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then ſhall it become apparent, that we are the trees of <hi>Frankincenſe</hi> here ſpoken of, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the kernels of the <hi>Pomegranates,</hi> and rightly planted in the Orchard of God.</p>

                  <p>The anſwer is,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſ. </seg>
                     </label> ſhe is a fountain ſealed to thoſe that are contemners of the Goſpel, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that ſaying in the Prophecy of <hi>Eſai.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The viſion of all, is become unto you, as the words of a Book that is ſealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, ſaying, read this, and he ſaith I cannot becauſe it is ſealed. So that although the Doctrine of the Goſpel be plain, and eaſy in it ſelf, and very ſweet and comfortable, yet where mans wiſdom ruleth, it cannot poſſibly be underſtood, but remains a miſtery hid and ſealed. Therefore it is no wonder to ſee great Clerks, men of excellent parts and learning, that cannot read the Book, that cannot underſtand any thing of the miſtery of the Kingdom of Heaven: the reaſon is, becauſe to them the ſpring is ſhut up, and the fountain is ſealed, for their horrible deſpiſing and contemning of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>And ſo on the contrary, ſhe is a fountain ſet open to water gardens, to refreſh and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy, <hi>every hungry and thirſty Soul.</hi> According to that in the Prophecy of <hi>Zachary,</hi> in that day there ſhall be a fountain ſet open for ſin,

                  <p>Now ſeeing the Lord hath made us his foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain we muſt endeavour to be full, to be of ſome deepneſs, that if any man come to draw the water of life, the fountain may not be empty; underſtanding is a well-ſpring of life, and a ſpring always runneth. The labour of the Church is to break up fountains.
<note place="margin">

                     <hi>As they go through the valley of Baca they make a well. And the promiſe of God is to open the ſpring,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>to make fountains in the valleys, and pools in the wilderneſs.</hi> Therefore let us receive of his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that if any man come with his Bucket, to have a taſt of the living water, he may not have a ſcantling; but may be ſure to have him fill'd.</p>
                  <p>And as we muſt be full, ſo alſo muſt we be willing to water gardens. The Lord hath paſſed by wiſdom and learning, and men of excellent parts and abilities in nature, and choſen poor, ignorant, deſpiſed, hungry and thirſty ſinners, to break up fountains; but to what end and purpoſe? Why hath the Lord hid the myſtery of the Kingdom of Heaven from the wiſe and prudent, and reveal'd it unto Babes? Even becauſe it ſo pleaſeth him, and alſo that the gardens may be watered.</p>
                  <p>The Lord hath promiſed to make the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs like <hi>Eden,</hi>

<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.10.</note> Therefore let us learn to anſwer the ſimilitude, to ſee that the fountain be full, and always running. If the gardens be not watered, what ſhall become of the flowers? And ſome flowers are more choice and principal then others, that give a greater ſcent, and are the very glory of the garden, if thoſe ſhould die, the beauty of the garden would be loſt. Therefore, when the ſun be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to ſhine hot upon the garden, and the flowers begin to be at a ſtand: when afflictions and great diſtreſſes, begin to draw on, when the ground begins to be dry and parched; then let us open the fountain, and pour out the water of life,

                  <p>Next the Church is ſaid to be a well of living waters.</p>
                  <p>This River or well is ſaid to be pure,

Pure in reſpect of the nature of it, it being nothing but the righteouſneſs of Chriſt given to the unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy. Clear in reſpect of the brightneſs or the light of it, it being clearly to be underſtood. And proceeding (in reſpect of the Original of it) out of the Throne of God, and of the Lamb.</p>
                  <p>There is a double Throne in Heaven, a Throne of Juſtice, and a Throne of mercy.
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:66021:110"/>The Throne of Juſtice is the Fathers Throne, and the Throne of mercy, is the ſons Throne. And there is a double Throne to be ſet in the Conſcience by the Preaching of the Goſpel. The Throne of God, and the Throne of the Lamb. The well of living waters do proceed out of both theſe Thrones. So that the water of life can never run into the Conſcience; unleſs it be arraigned, and brought in order before both theſe Thrones. For this is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Chriſt, to him that overcometh,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.21.</note> will I grant to ſit down with me in my Throne: even as I overcame and am ſet down with the Father in his Throne.</p>
                  <p>Now to overcome is to be delivered, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, and acquitted, (when the Conſcience is arraigned) from the Fathers Throne. For mark it, Chriſt entered combat with the Law, ſin, death and Satan, and overcame, but how? Even by ſubmitting himſelf to the curſe and comdemnation of them all, (which although unjuſt in reſpect of Chriſts innocent perſon, yet were all juſt in reſpect of us) and by his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection from the dead through the power of his Godhead he overcame, and received a full diſcharge from all our ſins, which he took in our name and keepeth for our uſe. By rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of which victory Chriſt is ſate down with the Father in his Throne.</p>
                  <p>After the ſame manner alſo we muſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and ſit down with Chriſt in his Throne, even by ſubmitting to the Office and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:66021:111"/>power of the Law, which revealeth our ſin, and condemneth our ſuppoſed wiſdom and righteouſneſs: then it is granted to us to ſit down with Chriſt in his Throne. This river then (or well of living waters) bringeth us, Firſt, before the judgment ſeat, condemning us before the fathers Throne: next, it leadeth us before the mercy ſeat, and ſetteth us down in the Sons Throne; giving us the victory which Chriſt hath purchaſed for us.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it is ſaid,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eze.</hi> 47.</note> that every thing that moveth whereſoever this River cometh ſhall live. That is, that moveth through faith, firſt, before the judgment ſeat, where it is condemned for ſin; next, before the mercy ſeat; where it is juſtified through grace. The benefit of this River runneth not to thoſe that are full rich, and mighty in their own ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination; but to thoſe only that confeſs their Sin.</p>
                  <p>Learn we then firſt by faith, to humble our ſelves before the Fathers Throne; then ſhall it preſently be granted unto us, to ſit down with Chriſt in his Throne.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, the Church is compar'd to ſtreams from <hi>Lebanon,</hi> having ſome alluſion (as ſome think) to the ſtreams of <hi>Jordan</hi> which began at the foot of Mount <hi>Lebanon,</hi> and ran along through the holy Land to water the ſame. And alſo to the Sanctuary; which was built of the <hi>Cedars</hi> of <hi>Lebanon.</hi> So that the ſtreams of this River do water the holy Land. The
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:66021:111"/>waters iſſuing out of the Sanctuary, do run into the deſert, and refreſh the weary and the ſolitary place. The water in this River, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not to the high and mighty in their own eyes, but to the poor and miſerable that are forſaken of the Law: they only refreſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with theſe pure and holy ſtreams; when <hi>the rich are ſent empty away.</hi>

                  <p>BY the <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South-winds</hi> are meant Doctrine, for ſo the <hi>winds</hi> do uſually ſignify in Scripture. And ſeeing they are of contrary qualities, they ſignify the Doctrine of the Law, and the Doctrine of the Goſpel. The <hi>North-wind</hi> is uſually cold and dry, and maketh us ſenſible when we feel the blaſt of it, that's the Doctrine of the Law: which being truly opened and applyed, maketh us very cold,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:66021:112"/>revealeth unto us our ſin, dryeth up all the wiſdom and righteouſneſs that is within us, blaſteth it and bringeth it to nothing. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt here appointeth the <hi>North-wind</hi> to awake; that is, <hi>to awake the ſpouſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now when the <hi>North-wind</hi> hath done blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Chriſt here Commandeth the <hi>South-wind</hi> to blow, which is of a contrary quality, hot and moiſt, very ſweet and full of content. This ſignifieth the Doctrine of the Goſpel. By which we underſtand, that when the Law hath done its Office in condemning us, and we are made ſenſible of our guiltineſs before God, it is the will of Chriſt; that we hear and apply our ſelves to the Goſpel. When by the blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>North-wind</hi> thoſe fruits that grow naturally are blaſted: then we muſt deſire for the blowing of the <hi>South-wind.</hi> When ever the winds do blow after this manner, in order upon the garden, then the ſpices thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to flow out, then the light of the Goſpel begins to ſhine in the Conſcience, and men are hot or cold according to the quality of the wind that blows. When the <hi>North-wind</hi> blows we are cold in reſpect of the righteouſneſs of the Law: and when the <hi>South-wind</hi> blows hot and comfortable in reſpect of the righteouſneſs of the Goſpel. Both theſe winds we muſt have an equal reſpect unto, and obſerve a right diſtinction between them, otherwiſe we may
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:66021:112"/>take that for the <hi>South-wind</hi> which comes to ſhort of the South by many points: and that for the <hi>North-wind</hi> which is as many points to wide of the North, and ſo fruits of the garden <hi>(for want of a right diſtinction between the winds, and a right knowledg of the compaſs)</hi> may receive a blaſt and be utterly ruin'd. This I conceive was the ſin of the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> in that ſhe was neither hot nor cold, ſhe neither un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the Law nor the Goſpel: had ſhe been hot, or cold, ſhe had been well, either would have ſerved for her commendation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are never alone. But becauſe ſhe could not make an exact diſtinction betwixt the <hi>North and South-winds,</hi> therefore ſhe was neither hot nor cold, but luke warm, and for that cauſe Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I will ſpue the out of my mouth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore it is that Chriſt alſo wiſheth, <hi>I would thou wert either cold or hot, for then ſhe had been in a right Condition.</hi> As if Chriſt had ſaid this. If thou wert awakened by the <hi>North-wind,</hi> then the <hi>South-wind</hi> ſhould blow in thy Conſcience: and if the <hi>South-wind</hi> did blow in thy Conſcience, then ſhould'ſt thou rightly underſtand how to follow the <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind</hi> in thy Life. Where theſe winds of Heaven do after this manner blow, the uſe and office of the Law and Goſpel is rightly Taught, and the reaſon of all good works is perceived, <hi>then the ſpices of the Garden do flow
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:66021:113"/>out:</hi> but when the Law is ſtretched beyond its limits, or the Goſpel turn'd into the Law, then men are neither <hi>hot nor cold, but luke warm,</hi> and under the ſame dreadful and heavy Sentence of Chriſt which can never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked; <hi>I will ſpue thee out of my mouth for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This thing is neceſſary to be underſtood of all men, eſpecially of the Angels of the Churches, that are the holders of the winds of Heaven and are to blow upon the garden of Chriſt, for if they ſhould not underſtand the contrary nature and quality of theſe winds, in ſtead of cauſing the ſpices to flow out: they may by a contrary wind cauſe a blaſt to come upon the garden to the ſpoil and utter ruin of all the fruits. For want of a right diſtinction between the nature of theſe winds, it oftentimes comes to paſs, that ſo many winds of Doctrine are blown about, that many are thereby blown into Everlaſting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
                  <p>In the next words here is a prayer of the Church wherein ſhe deſireth her beloved to come into his Garden, and eat his pleaſant fruits.</p>

                  <p>Our eating is, when we firmly believe, that Chriſt joineth himſelf unto us; feeleth our preſent infirmities, and careth for us.

                  <p>And by fruits here, ſhe meaneth the fruits of his death and Reſurrection, which is free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and liberty to poor ſinners. <hi>Theſe are called his fruits,</hi> becauſe freedom from ſin, and deliverance from Everlaſting Condemnation, are purchaſed by him. <hi>And his pleaſant fruits,</hi> becauſe when we believe that Chriſt owneth us,

                  <p>WHICH words contain the anſwer of Chriſt to the faith of his Church, for in theſe words he doth not ſay I will come, according to her requeſt: but I am come, according to her faith going before. Which alſo ſheweth us the meaning of the Prophet when he ſaith, <hi>before they call I will anſwer.</hi> And yet he willeth us to call upon him, for all things which he promiſeth to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow: becauſe Prayer muſt put in execution the decree of God, concerning what he hath promiſed to give us; neither can we chuſe but pray, as ſoon as we believe.</p>
                  <p>After the ſame manner ſhall it be to us, as with the Church here, when we believe and confeſs, that it is Chriſts delight to help us, and to our faith do joyn Prayer: when we can pray unto God for Chriſt his ſake to ſhew mercy to us, to bear our burdens, to carry our ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:66021:115"/>to come down into his garden and own us: then doth Chriſt ſpeak the ſame word to us, as he doth to the Church in this place, I am come into <hi>my Garden, my Siſter, my ſpouſe.</hi> By which we ſee, that Chriſt cometh to us before we are aware, for as ſoon as we believe the benefits of Chriſts death and Reſurrection to be given to us, that are moſt unworthy of the ſame: our faith incloſeth Chriſt, as a Jewel is incloſed in a Ring, then doth Chriſt ſay unto us, <hi>I am come my Siſter, my Spouſe.</hi> Neither could he poſſibly ſay otherwiſe, foraſmuch as he hath made over himſelf and all that he hath, to that perſon that believeth.</p>
                  <p>This is a rare and Heavenly miſtery, which whoſoever underſtandeth; ſhall quickly find that of Chriſt, which he never knew before. Thus Chriſt was preſent to the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> of old, as ſoon as they believed, <hi>Abraham</hi> by faith, ſaw his day and rejoyced. He had not only faith, but alſo a ſence of faith, which was bred in him by a certain knowledg of the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt imputed. So all the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that rightly underſtood the figures and ſhadows, had Chriſt preſent in ſpirit, as ſoon as they believed: the uſe of a figure being to repreſent ſomething to faith, which is abſent to ſenſe and reaſon. So Baptiſm which is a figure,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1, 9, 19, 20.</note> hath Chriſt preſent, as ſoon as we hear and believe that we are buried with Chriſt in Baptiſm,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.</note> and alſo aſſureth us of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him.</p>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:66021:115"/>
                  <p>And it is impoſſible (as was ſaid before) that it ſhould be otherwiſe, foraſmuch as all things being eſtabliſhed in faith: Chriſt cannot be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, where faith is preſent. No man by his works can poſſibly obtain this union, becauſe no work can cleave unto the word of God; but faith attaineth, poſſeſſeth and enjoyeth Chriſt for ever, becauſe all things in Heaven and Earth are given to them that believe. <hi>Mary took pains in ſeeking after Chriſt, ſhe went to the Sepulchre, ſhe wept becauſe ſhe could not find him: and why could ſhe not find him? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe ſought him where he was not to be found, ſhe ſought him in the Sepulchre, the living amongſt the dead: but as ſoon as Chriſt ſaid Mary, ſhe ſaid unto him</hi> Rabboni. <hi>Chriſt incloſed Mary by his word: and Mary by her faith incloſed him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the ſame manner Chriſt wrappeth us up in his word, when he giveth himſelf and all that he hath unto us: and we after the ſame manner, do incloſe and wrap up Chriſt and all his merits within us by faith. So when we come to the Lords Supper, Chriſt is Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally preſent in theſe words, this cup is the new Teſtament in my blood which is ſhed for you, now he that feeling his own miſerable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, can give ſo much credit to the word of God, as to believe, that under the figure of the cup the New Teſtament is given, to his own poor Soul in particular, that's the perſon to whom Chriſt is then come.</p>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:66021:116"/>
                  <p>Therefore, when the Law condemneth us of right, and by juſt deſert, and we are griev'd and burthened with our miſery; and do feel our wants and would have a ſupply, then muſt we fly to the Goſpel for help and ſuccour, and chiefly to our Baptiſm; which aſſureth us, (if we learn it well) that Chriſt by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes is preſent, to rid us of all evils, and to ſupply us in all our wants. This conſideration freeth us from condemnation, becauſe we are under the ſign and ſeal of abſolution and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins. And thus Baptiſm is the figure that ſaveth us. The Law condemneth, and the Conſcience accuſeth, but faith bringeth into the mind the right uſe of the ſign and ſeal of abſolution and forgiveneſs. To ſeek for Chriſt in our works, is with <hi>Mary</hi> to ſeek him in the Sepulchre, where he cannot be found, and to look for a Chriſt yet to come. For holineſs of life is yet to come, cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in this miſerable fleſh, but is ſtill to be waited for. Now if we cannot apprehend Chriſts ſpiritual preſence to be with us, until we are better ſanctified: then we can never apprehend him to be come at all. Foraſmuch as a better degree of Sanctification is yet to come, and ſtill will be to come ſo long as we are on this ſide Heaven. Learn we then firmly to believe the word of Chriſt and to deny our ſelves, and call up on his name, then ſhall we feel to our comfort that Chriſt is ſpiritually come to us, according as Chriſt ſays here to his ſpouſe, <hi>I am come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:66021:116"/>
                  <p>Next here, Chriſt calleth his Church his <hi>ſiſter and ſpouſe.</hi> Which words are often uſed in this Song to draw the Church to this holy faith and confeſſion, and are alſo full of faith and conſolation. For if Chriſt doth own us for his <hi>ſiſter and ſpouſe,</hi> then is he our brother and husband.</p>
                  <p>Therefore theſe words <hi>my ſpouſe,</hi> muſt teach us to believe, and to claim theſe benefits that belong to the ſpouſe. For the wife ſo long as the husband liveth, is free and out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger by reaſon of the Marriage knot. Now Chriſt liveth for ever for he being raiſed from the dead dyeth no more.

Now if God be our Father then it muſt needs follow that we are the Children of God, and after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner we muſt learn to receive the Spirit of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even by hearing of the word of faith.

                  <p>In theſe words Chriſt further amplifies his anſwer to the faith and requeſt of his Church, and ſays, <hi>I have gathered,</hi> that is, <hi>I have reaped the fruits for which I came down from Heaven for, which was to draw a people to believe in me that they might be ſaved.</hi> From whence we may ſee, that as ſoon as we are willing that Chriſt ſhould eaſe us of all our ſins and miſeries, and make a gratious ſupply of all our wants, then do we prepare a diſh of pleaſant fruits for Chriſt: this is that which he here calleth <hi>his Myrrhe and his Spice, his Wine and his Milk,</hi> becauſe as thoſe things are ſweet and do much refreſh the ſenſes of men; So alſo is it ſweet to Chriſt to take away from us, our ſins and burthens, cares, croſſes and calamities.</p>
                  <p>Moreover when Chriſt alſo ſaith here, that he hath <hi>eaten his honey comb with his honey;</hi> it muſt well be noted, for he <hi>eateth his honey comb with his own honey.</hi> The comb is the Houſe of the Bee which holdeth the honey, which honey although it be ſweet for the Bee to feed on, yet the comb is reſpected of the Bee firſt, before the honey, for the Bee by a natural inſtinct delighteth in the comb, having no other
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:66021:117"/>houſe nor reſting place, to rejoyce it ſelf in, and ſet its heart upon but only the comb: which although it hath no ſweetneſs in it of it ſelf, before it be ſweetned by the labour of the Bee, yet for the natural pleaſure he taketh in it, more then in all things in the World beſides; he maketh it his habitation and place of abode, ſo that there is an Antecedent natural inſtinct in the Bee, Firſt <hi>to the comb, and then to feed upon the honey in the comb.</hi>

                  <p>This is his Antecedent love, and when it is ſaid in the ſixteenth of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Father himſelf loveth you becauſe ye have loved me, as though the Father had firſt reſpect to the honey and then to the comb,</hi> it meaneth his conſequent love; for as ſoon as we receive our firſt love, which is to believe that he loveth our ſinful perſon, then doth he love our obedience with a conſequent love, and maketh promiſes accordingly to thoſe that love him, fear him, obey him, and keep his Commandments.</p>
                  <p>It follows therefore, that all thoſe that are imployed in the garden of the Lord, about the making and ſweetning of honey combs muſt endeavour to imitate the Bee, firſt in making of the comb, next, in gathering of honey and conveying it into the comb. If the comb be not firſt reſpected there can be no honey, then muſt the Bees die for want of food. Nor is there any other way to make perſons holy; firſt, but by teaching us to believe that Chriſt loveth us from all Eternity. Where this perſwaſion is grounded, <hi>honey dews will fall,</hi> for why ſhould the Bee labour to make the comb, if it were not his purpoſe to fill it with honey? Why ſhould the Lord Jeſus Chriſt marry our ſinful perſon to himſelf, if it were not to ſweeten and perfume it with an Odour fit for himſelf?</p>
                  <p>And as the comb muſt firſt be made, ſo muſt we ſee that it be well ſtored with honey, which
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:66021:118"/>muſt be gathered with the Bee out of every flower, and where ever the honey dew falls, the Bees will find it out, mark we then where the cowſlips, the flowers and the honey ſuckles grow, for thoſe are the places where the Bees find honey, and if any dew fall there we ſhall find it; and when ſuch dews come the Bees will lade themſelves, and when they have their lading they carry it to their combs: if the Bees ſhould gather ever ſo much honey and had not the Art to carry it into the combs, what profit ſhould the owner of the Bees re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive?</p>
                  <p>If the Miniſters of the Goſpel ſhould have their full lading of honey, and had not the Art to convey it into the Conſciences of men to make perſons holy, who were the better for it? Some there are that cannot endure the taſt of the hony ſuch can never ſweeten the comb: but are like waſps that rob the Bees and make honey ſcarce.</p>
                  <p>Therefore let all thoſe that are labourers for God endeavour ſo to be fill'd with the knowledg of the Goſpel, that they may be able to ſet down the true way to attain to the righteouſneſs of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and all grounds of encouragment to receive it, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſt in the next words.</p>

                  <p>To eat in Divinity is to be joyned to the Goſpel by faith,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.54.</note> and whoſoever eateth hath Everlaſting life. Now the Goſpel (that we may learn rightly to eat) teacheth us three prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal points.

                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.10, 11, 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.21, 22.</note> it teacheth the true underſtanding of the Law, which revealeth ſin to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, whereby all men are convicted: and that mans natural opinion, that obedience to the Law is the condition of the promiſes may be deſtroyed and requireth our faith in this point, and alſo giveth and worketh in us the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Goſpel teacheth us that the righteouſneſs of Chriſt is freely given to them only,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.2, 3.</note> where that opinion of righteouſneſs is deſtroyed, and alſo requireth our faith in this point, and worketh in us the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it requireth us to perform all good works towards men without any dependance upon them,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3, 8, 9. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.4.</note> and cauſeth us to perform the ſame with joy and gladneſs.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the principal things taught in the the Goſpel, and the principal Doctrines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in both Sacraments. And where theſe three points are taught, there the Sacraments <hi>(or the Goſpel)</hi> are rightly taught. Therefore
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:66021:119"/>when Chriſt ſays eat, he requireth that the Goſpel be made known, that we may be joyned unto him in theſe three points.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eat O friends.</hi> Some think that open groſs ſinners are not invited to eat, let ſuch conſider of the firſt point before named: and ſhew how they ſhall be convicted, and have their ſins deſtroyed, if they muſt not eat.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, others think that by friends here, <hi>(and in other places of Scripture)</hi> Chriſt meaneth thoſe that ſtrive much about the Law and works, and require a neceſſity of doing to obtain the promiſes. Let ſuch conſider of the ſecond point before named, and ſhew how the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip comes in that way, and ſee what need they have to eat.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, ſome are affraid to eat, becauſe they are unworthy by reaſon of ſinful works. But the diſcontent of theſe in the want of works, ſhews, that they do depend upon works, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch muſt examine themſelves by the third point, and they ſhall find, that they alſo, have great need to eat for the deſtroying of that opinion in them.</p>
                  <p>We ſee then that all ſorts of people have need to eat. Open groſs ſinners, and thoſe that are righteous in their own eyes, and alſo thoſe that are fearful at their own unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs.</p>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:66021:120"/>
                  <p>But why doth Chriſt call all that are invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his friends?

                     </label> becauſe there is no enmity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining on Gods part, Chriſt having ſlain the enmity:
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.15.</note> the enmity is on our part. God is reconciled to us through the death of his Son, but we are not reconciled to God. Now God being reconciled,
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cro.</hi> 5.19, 20.</note> ſendeth the Goſpel <hi>(which is the word of reconciliation)</hi> to publiſh the ſame: wherein he calleth us friends, on purpoſe to woo and invite us to himſelf.</p>
                  <p>And if we receive the Goſpel, then there is no difference between God and us, but if we deſpiſe his bounty, and will not have his merits, then are we his enemies. Neither doth God account any for his enemies, but thoſe that refuſe to have life and ſalvation by that new and living way which he hath appointed. This news is brought unto us by the Goſpel, by which Doctrine the Law is opened, which ſheweth us, as in a glaſs our miſerable and wretched condition; and that Chriſt came to purchaſe deliverance for us, and to bring it into our Conſciences, that we might ſerve him with cheerfulneſs all the days of our lives. This is the feaſt he provideth, and biddeth us eat, which is, to make a right application of the Law and Goſpel in order as aforeſaid. And calleth us friends, becauſe the Goſpel maketh us friends. And biddeth us drink alſo, becauſe he would aſſure us hereby of his real
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:66021:120"/>and hearty good will to us: and that he giveth to us freely of the <hi>bread and water of life.</hi> And to drink abundantly, to ſhew that he doth not grudge us any thing that he hath purchaſed for poor ſinners: or that might beget in us a good opinion of himſelf towards us. And telleth us that we are his wel-beloved, as much beloved, as ever were any upon the face of the earth, that his heart is upon us, and his care for us; and that he cannot, nor will not, ever be wanting to us.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things are written on purpoſe that we might believe, and that we might have no other opinion of God but according to theſe words: that we might acknowledg him to be free and bountiful to us and our God. Such a faith can never want any help or protection that is in God. Heaven and Earth, yea the whole Creation ſhall work together to accompliſh what is wanting for the believing man. Let us ſee therefore, that we believe the Goſpel to be no other Doctrine, but that which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth the opinion in us, of all worth in our ſelves, and that poureth forth unto us of the bounty and loving kindneſs of God moſt free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; that we might ſerve him with a willing ſervice. Thoſe that define the Goſpel any otherwiſe, do ſet forth a ſtrange God; by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolling the righteouſneſs in man, which is but to bleſs an Idol of their own brain.</p>
                  <p>And let us alſo ſee that we join our ſelves to the Goſpel, and count it great riches to
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:66021:121"/>behold our ſpiritual poverty, and to have our filthy rags to be taken from us, and the beſt robe to be put upon us: that we may do good works (not in fear) but with joyfulneſs, then ſhall we rightly eat the fleſh, and drink the blood of the Son of God, and have eternal life through his name.</p>
                  <p>And ſeeing he calleth us friends, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to us, let us alſo be reconciled to him, and not be offended. And whatſoever we want let us aske it of him, who can deny us nothing becauſe he is our friend. And ſeeing he bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us drink, and drink abundantly, let us be ſure that what ever is promiſed in the Goſpel is certainly ours as if we had it in preſent poſſeſſion. And ſith he telleth us that we are his welbeloved let us believe him, and never queſtion his love to us any more; and what calamities ſoever we meet with in this World, let us be ſure <hi>(although they are tedious and irksom to the fleſh to indure)</hi> they are for noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but to manifeſt, his free and everlaſting love to us. What remaineth then? Seeing Chriſt is ſo willing, ſo free, ſo full of bounty and loving kindneſs to us, but that we ſtore our ſelves with rich and heavenly proviſion againſt a rainy day. In this world we ſhall ſee little appearance of any thing but <hi>Satan,</hi> uſing all Art and skill by his inſtruments, to take away our peace, and blaſt our comforts: and many times hath great power given him ſo to do, therefore he attempteth to devour us,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:66021:121"/>which he knoweth he cannot do unleſs he can deſtroy our faith, and deprive us of our Chriſt: therefore we had need to eat and drink abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly of this heavenly proviſion, that when we feel our ſelves oppreſſed with the tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the world, and malice of <hi>Satan;</hi> we may be ſo ſtrong in the Lord and in the power of his might, that we may be able to conquer all our ſpiritual enemies.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>THeſe words are the voice of the Church, who when ſhe heareth Chriſt pour out himſelf ſo abundantly to her, falleth <hi>aſleep.</hi> Sleep is a reſt or ceaſing from the uſe of the outward ſenſes: and in this place ſignifies the ſilencing of ſenſe and reaſon in the uſe and exerciſe of faith. For when Chriſt biddeth her <hi>(in the former verſe)</hi> eat and drink abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, he promiſeth all things, both for this life, and the life to come: yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe ſeeth not how, nor which way thoſe promiſes ſhall be accompliſhed, for the word ſeemeth to promiſe incredible things to reaſon, as that <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhall have a Son in his old age
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:66021:122"/>contrary to nature, that <hi>Sarah</hi> ſhall bring forth <hi>the promiſed ſeed, when ſhe is paſt Child bearing.</hi> Alſo it ſetteth forth unto us, that <hi>Iſaac</hi> muſt be offer'd; and yet in him all Nations ſhall be bleſſed.</p>
                  <p>Moreover it promiſeth help to the afflicted, when no means appeareth, how or which way deliverance ſhall come: but in ſtead of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending any help or deliverance according to ſenſe and reaſon, there ſhall nothing appear but utter ruin and deſtruction. In this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition <hi>the Bride falleth aſleep,</hi> ſhe is content to have ſenſe and reaſon ſilenc'd, and to be ſtrick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en dumb, and ſhe is not diſcouraged; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly dependeth upon the promiſes of God. And therefore ſhe ſays here, <hi>I ſleep, but mine heart waketh.</hi> I ſleep in regard of ſenſe and reaſon; but my heart awaketh in reſpect of God and his promiſes. And this is alſo the meaning of <hi>David</hi> when he ſays, he giveth his beloved <hi>ſleep,</hi> or by <hi>ſleep. So that when the Bride doth thus begin to ſleep: then doth ſhe begin to awake, and live by faith in the promiſes of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the ſame manner muſt we with the Bride fall into this holy ſleep, and be contented to live in the uſe and practice of faith. For every man in his condition ſhall find all things fall out contrary to his expectation, in all eſtates and conditions of life: and alſo ſhall ſeem to appear directly contrary to the promiſes of God.</p>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:66021:122"/>
                  <p>Who promiſeth, that no good thing ſhall be wanting to thoſe that fear him: and yet a man ſhall ſeem in likelyhood, to be in want of every good thing. That wealth and riches ſhall be in his houſe, and yet a man ſhall behold nothing but penury and want. This breedeth a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful temptation in the godly, ſo that a man is ready in this condition to fall into one of theſe evils; either to accuſe and condemn God of lying, or elſe to conclude, that he is not the perſon to whom the promiſes are made. What muſt be done then in this condition? Even to fall a ſleep with the Bride, and to be contented that reaſon may be ſlain, and to lead a new life by faith in promiſes of God. This ſlaying of reaſon is the awakening of the heart, and then it doth begin to hear, and rightly to underſtand the words of Chriſt, according to the next words here following.</p>
                  <q>—It is the voice of my beloved that knocketh; ſaying, Open to me my ſiſter, my love, my dove, my undefiled—</q>
                  <p>This knocking is, when the Church is caſt into the uſe and exerciſe of faith. To knock is to make a noiſe, and it may be defined thus.</p>
                  <p>It is an noiſe in the Conſcience, ariſing from the ſenſe of ſin and apprehenſion of danger. It is when the very voice of the curſe is felt in
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:66021:123"/>the Conſcience: and the miſerable effects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are feared. This ſhe ſays is the voice of her beloved, becauſe the right opening of the Law, that maketh the ſtroke, and that the ſtroke of it may be felt, belongeth to the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>And further, when her beloved knocketh, he ſaith open, ſo that as ſoon as the knock is heard, <hi>the Bride is to open.</hi> According to <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. <hi>If any man hear my voice and open the dore, I will come in and ſup with him, and he ſhall ſup with me.</hi> I will take from him the hurt of all evils whatſoever, that ſhall be my ſupper; and I will beſtow all things upon him to make him comfortable and happy, that ſhall be his Supper. So that here is a twofold Supper, Chriſt ſuppeth, and the Bride ſuppeth. Chriſt hath his delight in taking away her calamities: the Bride hath her delight in receiving all bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and comforts. And this comes to paſs by opening.</p>
                  <p>Now to open, is rightly to underſtand the meaning or end of the knock. Which in ſum is this. To inform the Bride, that all her wants ſhall be ſupplyed by the Goſpel; which cannot be ſupplyed by her own ways and works. Thus Chriſt after the manner of a Lover ſtands and knocks, waiting to enlighten the Church in this point. So that whether her wants be ſpiritual or temporal, for this life or the life to come, they ſhall all be ſupplyed <hi>(when ſhe is loſt by the Law)</hi> by ways and means unknown
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:66021:123"/>if ſhe believeth. And this is the end of every knock. But for want of underſtanding the meaning of the knock, the noiſe is many times of long continuance. For many inſtead of ſtud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying how to believe, that they may attain all things by the Goſpel: do ſtrive to relieve themſelves by their own wiſdom and works, and in the end loſe their labour, and the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel too.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, when we begin to hear a noiſe in the inward man, and to fall into great fear, either in regard of our ſins, and the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting judgment of God, or by reaſon of ſome grievous temporal judgment which we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend to hang over our heads: let us be ſure then that Chriſt knocketh, not to put us in feare, <hi>(for he affrighteth no man)</hi> but to take away our fears from us, ſo that although it ſeem terrible to us upon the firſt apprehenſion of the knock; yet it is but the voice of our beloved, who ſtandeth and knocketh, not to execute the Law upon us, but to take all our evils upon himſelf that we may be made joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and happy.</p>
                  <p>The hearing then of the noiſe muſt cauſe us to open the dore, that is to believe in Chriſt, and call upon his name, and to ſuffer him to come in and ſup with us: then ſhall we be freed from all our fears, and although we have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited all things by the Law, yet, we ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit all things by faith in the Goſpel.</p>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:66021:124"/>
                  <p>Alſo we muſt open, that the captivity of the Conſcience may firſt be turned into liberty and freedom, before we ſeek for deliverance in reſpect of the outward man. <hi>(according to Chriſt ſaying, ſeek firſt the Kingdom of Heaven and the righteouſneſs thereof, and all things elſe ſhall be given unto you)</hi> That ſo from that liberty and freedom which the Conſcience poſſeſſeth through faith in Chriſt; the merciful care and providence of God might flow in upon us, and the nature of the whole Creation might be changed to us.</p>
                  <p>Now becauſe in times of diſtreſs the Church is apt to be diſcouraged, Chriſt here uſeth words that ſhew relations between them: <hi>as my ſiſter, my love, my dove, my undefiled.</hi> Which in brief is this. <hi>Thou art my ſiſter, and I am thy loving brother, and companion in tribulation: and am affected with all thy afflictions. Thou art my love, my only joy and delight, therefore I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forſake thee: but do ſtand and knock to join my ſelf unto thee, to take all evils and miſeries from thee, and to ſettle thee in peace and joy. Thou art my dove, that forſakeſt not thy mate in a mournful condition. And becauſe thou runneſt not from me, but yeeldeſt thy ſelf unto me, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou art mine, therefore thou art undefiled: thy ſins are waſhed away, and thou art clean. I came down from Heaven on purpoſe to Cloath my ſelf with thy fleſh; that I might free thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience from all diſtreſs, and fill it with peace and joy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:66021:124"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Open therefore unto me, and receive that by the new and living way, which according to the Law and works thou haſt utterly loſt.</hi> Theſe are the words of faith which we muſt have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe unto in times of diſtreſs: being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to us, and uſeful for us.</p>
                  <q>—For my head is fill'd with dew, and my locks with the drops of the Night.</q>
                  <p>In theſe words Chriſt ſheweth the reaſon, why the Church ſhall receive all things by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, it is, becauſe his head <hi>is fill'd with dew, and his locks with the drops of the Night.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the head of Chriſt is meant his Divinity,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</note> the head of Chriſt is God. And by <hi>his locks</hi> underſtand his humanity. And by <hi>the drops of the night</hi> his ſufferings in the fleſh. And by <hi>the dew that his head is fill'd</hi> with the fulneſs of merit in the Godhead, which made all the actions done in the manhood Meritorius: and alſo the pouring out of the benefit thereof by pure and Heavenly Doctrine, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to poor ſinners; which Doctrine drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as <hi>the dew.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that the obedience of God and man in one perſon,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.</note> poured out in the Preaching of the Goſpel, and received by faith: <hi>is the ground and foundation of all our comfort and joy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:66021:125"/>
                  <p>For Chriſt by his obedience hath taken away the ground of all diſcomforts,

                     <hi>and nailed it to his Croſs:</hi> which being made known by the Goſpel, and received by faith, ſetleth us in true peace and comfort. This muſt teach us, that when we are moſt of all oppreſſed with <hi>the drops of the night,</hi> with the feeling of our ſins, or the fear of any croſs or calamity; to fly to the humanity of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt who hath ſuffered for us. And ſtedfaſtly to believe, that ſeeing the locks of our beloved, were filled with the droppings of our preſent condition, that he is not only ſenſible of our preſent miſery, but alſo knoweth how to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour us and help us.</p>
                  <p>And hath alſo taken away the curſe, from every condition of miſery, that poſſibly we may meet with in this miſerable World, if we believe.

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>THe Church underſtanding the benefits that come to her by the Goſpel, and the order in receiving of it, ſays, <hi>I have put off my Coat:</hi> by which ſhe meaneth the righteouſneſs of the Law in point of juſtification. This is the firſt thing taught in the Goſpel,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.31.</note> how to <hi>put off our old Coat.</hi> And the firſt thing that Chriſt came to do, was to put on our Coat upon himſelf: whereby he became laden with our ſins, and alſo with our infirmities. The coat being thus put on by Chriſt: therefore the Church learneth to put him off by faith. So that this place doth not ſhew any ſluggiſhneſs in the Church, as if ſhe were in a bed of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity with her coat off, and as though ſhe were loath to riſe and go about the works of the Law, but leadeth us into an higher matter, how to attain to be righteous before God. This wiſdom muſt we alſo learn, which we can never do, unleſs we remove the cauſe for which we keep our coat on, which is our falſe opinion of the Law. Some when they treat of the Law and works, do preſs it with that earneſtneſs, that they extol the righteouſneſs
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:66021:126"/>thereof, far beyond the righteouſneſs of faith: as if the principal cauſe of Chriſts coming into the world, were to make us holy by the Law. Theſe with the <hi>Phariſee</hi> do button on the coat. Others, will have Chriſtian righteouſneſs to begin in us, and perfected by Chriſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> which is but to put a piece of new cloth in an old garment, and make the rent worſe. Learn we then to put off our coat wholly. But next the Church queſtioneth here, how ſhall I put it on? That is in life and converſation. For the greateſt and moſt neceſſary queſtion of all others in matters of Divinity, is rightly to underſtand theſe two things. How to lay aſide the Law totally, in teaching the point of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: and how to teach the uſe and practiſe of the Law rightly, in the life and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. How to handle theſe two points aright, that the Goſpel may not deſtroy the uſe and practice of the Law:
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9.</note> nor the Law the uſe and practice of the Goſpel, is a point of great skill.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the Church maketh queſtion <hi>(as if ſhe were ſomething ignorant in this point)</hi> how ſhall I put it on? How ſhall I teach this point aright? If the works of the Law ought not to be required, but totally to be layed aſide, in teaching the way to juſtification: according as it is written, the Law is not made for a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man, upon what ground then are they to be preſſed at all?</p>
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:66021:126"/>
                  <p>All men have cauſe to complain of their ignorance in this point: therefore it muſt be our deſire to learn this heavenly skill. Now to cloath our ſelves with the Law that the uſe and practice of it may not be loſt: and how to be unclothed of the Law, that the Goſpel may not be loſt. This is a point of great cunning, and ought to be well ſtudied of every Chriſtian, chiefly, becauſe the ſtrongeſt hold of <hi>Satans</hi> Kingdom conſiſteth in the confounding of theſe two points one with another. Therefore it is further added here.
<q>—<hi>I have waſhed my feet how ſhall I defile them?</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where by feet ſhe meaneth the inward man, and by waſhing, the cleanſing of the Soul through faith in Chriſt:
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Joh.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </note> according to Chriſts ſaying, he that is waſhed needeth not ſave to waſh his feet; but is clean every whit. But then it is added how ſhall I defile them? She had waſhed her feet by putting of her coat, whereby ſhe was cleanſed from ſin, therefore ſhe asketh the queſtion, how ſhall I defile them? As much as to ſay, how ſhall I preſs the works of the Law, ſo, as not to defile my feet again? If I ſhould urge a neceſſity of the Law, then I ſhould defile my feet, or if I ſhould totally caſt it off, becauſe I am juſtified without the Law: then I ſhould alſo defile my feet again,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:66021:127"/>for then it would come to paſs, that in living without the uſe and practice of the Law, my Conſcience would have no more the feeling and apprehenſion of ſin, nor any ſenſible need of a Saviour: So that in caſting away of all fear and care of the Law, I ſhould at laſt contemn and caſt away the Goſpel alſo. And the conſequence of all would be this, I ſhould forſake my beloved, loſe my peace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort here, and alſo everlaſting life here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                  <p>This ſheweth us the practice of the Bride in all ages of the Church, which is firſt to lay aſide the Law, next, to live in the uſe and practice of the Law. In receiving the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of juſtification, ſhe heareth no Law: but in the life and converſation, ſhe abideth in the uſe and practice of the Law.</p>
                  <p>All men ought to be well learn'd in this point, chiefly thoſe that are Teachers of others, that are to enlighten the world; that they may ſo Preach the Goſpel, that the Churches feet may be waſhed, and ſo teach the Law, that no mans feet may be defil'd again. If thou urgeſt a neceſſity of the Law, thou Preacheſt not the Goſpel, but defileſt thy mind and Conſcience: Foraſmuch as the Goſpel firſt of all deſtroyeth that opinion. Or if thou totally lay aſide the Law as uſeleſs to a believer, thou alſo defileſt thy feet: becauſe by that Doctrine thou driveſt the ſenſe and feeling of ſin out of the world: and alſo all ſenſible need of a Saviour. Every
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:66021:127"/>man hath ſomething yet to learn in this point, the very beſt of all are too ſhort in it. How to perform this duty aright, is a queſtion made by the Church in all ages as in this place we ſee.</p>
                  <p>Therefore all muſt be learners. And all conſiſteth in two points, how to be righteous before God: and how to be righteous before men. Which that it may be learned, and the way known how to attain it, it is further added.</p>

                  <p>MY beloved taught me how to diſtinguiſh betwixt faith and the Law, in Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the point of juſtification; and alſo how to join them together in Scripture and Doctrine. This is a rare and wonderful miſtery, which none can teach but Chriſt alone. In the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this point all men are at a loſs, until they are Divinely inſpir'd by the Holy Ghoſt. As for example, St. <hi>Paul</hi> telleth us in one Text,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.28.</note> 
                     <hi>that a man is juſtified by faith without the works of the Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:66021:128"/>
                  <p>And in another Text, <hi>that the doers of the Law ſhall be juſtified before God.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.13.</note> In both which Scriptures juſtification is attributed both to faith and alſo to the Law.</p>
                  <p>I queſtion then,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                     </label> how faith and the Law ſhall be ſeparated in this point, ſeeing juſtification is attributed to both?</p>
                  <p>Some will anſwer,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſ. </seg>
                     </label> that by doing is meant ſincerity, which God accepts of all though there be ſome wants. This is true after juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: but this maketh no diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween faith and the Law in the former point; but joineth them both together in the Act of juſtification. Therefore ſincerity being a term pertaining to the Law, and prefer'd ſo high as to juſtifie before God: it muſt be perfect every way according to the Law, <hi>which perfection no man ever had but Chriſt alone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Others ſay, that God gives a power with his Commands to enable thoſe that are his to perform the Law, ſo that he accepts of them in Chriſt, which is no more then this. That by Chriſts merits we have an infuſion of grace whereby we deſerve our juſtification, which comes to no more then the former.</p>
                  <p>Now if no ſeparation be made between faith and the Law, in the matter of juſtification, they cannot be joined together in Doctrine without repugnancy: Foraſmuch as no man can be juſtified by the Law, wherein he is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in many things, when it pronounceth the curſe upon all thoſe that continue not therein
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:66021:128"/>in all things. Neither can any mans works be accounted good before men: when they are drawn up into the judgment ſeat, and not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected towards men.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I ſay as before, that this Cardinal point, is ſo high and ſecret a myſtery, that none of the Scribes nor diſputers of the World can poſſibly reach unto, by any art or humane skill. So that unleſs the door be opened, the myſtery is hid, and all men remain in darkneſs: but the door being opened all things in the houſe are viſible and manifeſt. Therefore the Church ſaith here, <hi>my beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door:</hi> that is, to open all thoſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that ſeem to claſh againſt the Doctrine of faith, and to hinder mans righteouſneſs before God, and alſo which being not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, do ſpoil him of his righteouſneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men.</p>
                  <p>Now our beloved openeth, when we begin to underſtand what true obedience to the Law is, Namely, to believe and confeſs that we do it not.</p>
                  <p>According to Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Which is not to be underſtood of an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion but ſuch as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth from the ſight of ſin and hope of mercy.</hi>
                     </note> there is none that underſtandeth, <hi>there is none righteous:</hi> there is none that feareth God, but altogether are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come unprofitable, and abominable. This to believe and confeſs, is the firſt point in true obedience to the Law. Another is, when we ſubmit to the curſe which the Law pronounceth againſt us, and confeſs the ſentence of it to be moſt juſt. The laſt is, wholly to renounce
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:66021:129"/>the Law, <hi>and to ſeek after the righteouſneſs of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.21.</note> 
                     <hi>manifeſted without the Law:</hi> according as is required in the firſt Commandment, as is to be ſeen more largely in Song third, and Verſe ten.</p>
                  <p>And let us alſo note this, that as ſoon as we feel and confeſs our death and condemnation by the Law, then are we become dead to the Law, and the Law is become dead unto us. So that even as death diſſolves the compound, and makes a ſeparation between the Soul and Body: So doth this death alſo, untie the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, and make a ſeparation between the Conſcience and the Law. And the reaſon is, becauſe in renouncing the Law, and flying to Chriſt for righteouſneſs, the bargain or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant that was made with man at firſt, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing righteouſneſs by the Law, is diſſolved, or untied. This obedience it ſeemeth good to me, to call the Paſſive obedience, which is clean contrary to the Active, for in this obedience thou workeſt nothing but ſuffereſt thy ſelf to be driven from the carnal bed, to Chriſt by faith.</p>
                  <p>In this ſenſe <hi>the doers of the Law are juſtified before God.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.13.</note> And in the ſenſe they that do his Commandments have right to the <hi>tree of life.</hi> And in this ſenſe,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.</note> underſtand all the promiſes of God that are made to mans obedience. This Doctrine ſeparateth faith and the Law, in the matter of juſtification, and yet joineth them together in Scripture and Doctrine. For it
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:66021:129"/>ſheweth, that doing the Law to be juſtified, is to be underſtood of faithful and ſpiritual doing, and not of the active or moral doing. And alſo, as it ſetteth before us nothing but Gods free grace in juſtifying of us: So it breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in us that love to God and man which is required in the firſt and ſecond Table, which ſetteth us on to active obedience. For as a falſe opinion of the Law within us, ſpoileth us of our righteouſneſs before God and men: So alſo, doth the deſtroying of that opinion within us by the Goſpel, work in us a true and right obedience towards God and men. The ſum of all is this; that to believe and confeſs our own unrighteouſneſs, is the firſt point in Evangelical obedience.</p>
                  <p>With this confeſſion the righteouſneſs of faith begins: and to this confeſſion the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt belongs. Which every man muſt learn to believe, and this is the true doing of the Law in faith, by which means we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the grace and favour of God in Chriſt, and power to do good works before men.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the Bride ſaith here, my bowels were moved for him. After my beloved had once opened the door, and diſcovered unto me this heavenly myſtery: my bowels were moved, I was altogether made new, I was changed, and transformed, into another manner of Creature, my bowels were moved with love and thankfulneſs to God for his Infinit mercy to me: and alſo fill'd with love, mercy, and
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:66021:130"/>compaſſion towards others, which is the ſum and ſubſtance of both Tables.</p>
                  <p>This hole of the dore muſt therefore be rightly known, otherwiſe the obedience of faith can never be taught, but all people ſhall remain in darkneſs: but the hole being found, and the dore opened, Antichriſt is revealed, and the Kingdom of Heaven is opened. The Conſcience is eaſed, and God is pleaſed. Then ſhalt thou eaſily reconcile all Scriptures, <hi>(by the ſame rule)</hi> that ſeem to be at variance in this point, and walking in the practice thereof, thou ſhalt find ſuch a light opened in thy mind: that thou thy ſelf ſhalt ſay, thou never kneweſt before.</p>

                  <p>In this Verſe the behaviour of the Church is ſet down in her receiving of the ſame. She
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:66021:130"/>roſe up to open to her beloved. As ſoon as her beloved put in his hand by the hole of the dore, to open and unlock the myſtery of the Kingdom of Heaven, ſhe ſet her ſelf with all attentiveneſs and dilligence to hear and receive the ſame. She did not fight againſt the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of her beloved, nor judge it before ſhe heard it: but roſe up to open and receive the ſame.</p>
                  <p>And then ſhe declareth the effects that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, my hands ſhe ſaith, dropped with <hi>Myrrhe,</hi> and my ſingers with ſweet ſmelling <hi>Myrrhe,</hi> which meaneth, into the hearts and Conſciences of others.</p>
                  <p>It is not much material to obſerve the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction here betwixt the hands, and the fingers.</p>
                  <p>A thing is ſaid to be handled, or taken in hand, according to Saint <hi>Luke,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.</note> when an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly Declaration is made to others, of thoſe things that are firmly believed, by thoſe that make report of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>And it may alſo be ſaid to be touched <hi>(as it were with fingers)</hi> when it is more briefly and compendiouſly drawn up into a ſhort ſum or ſentence of words. Now both theſe do drop the <hi>Myrrhe,</hi> not only when the Doctrine is throughly and perfectly handled, but alſo when it is more briefly touched: for ſo the Bride ſaith here, <hi>my fingers dropped with ſweet ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Myrrhe, and it was upon the handles of the Lock.</hi>

                  <p>A Lock is that which faſtneth the dore, that nothing within the Houſe can be ſeen, unleſs the dore be unlock'd. Therefore by the Lock we muſt underſtand that bar or hinderance, that hindereth the Goſpel from entring into the Soul: which Lock or bar is only unbelief, which ſin alone ſtandeth in direct oppoſition to the Goſpel. And the buſineſs of the Church is to open the grounds and reaſons of the ſame. And when ſhe was diſcovering the myſtery of iniquity, by opening the grounds of unbelief, and laying the foundation of faith, ſhe ſaith, <hi>her hands dropped with Myrrhe, and her fingers with ſweet ſmelling Myrrhe.</hi>

                  <p>For the annointing oyl which was made for the Prieſts, and alſo for the Tabernacle and his veſſels, which was compounded with <hi>Myrrhe</hi> was holy, whoſoever was annointed with it was holy, and whoſoever touched it was holy. Therefore whereſoever this <hi>Myrrhe</hi> is dropped, it maketh the perſon holy. And for this reaſon, ſhe calleth her Doctrine, <hi>the ſweet ſmelling Myrrhe,</hi> becauſe it maketh thoſe where it is dropped, ſweet in the ſight of God; ſweet in the ſight of Conſcience, and alſo a ſweet Savour in every place.</p>
                  <p>By this the practice of the Church may be ſeen in all ages. Which is firſt to open and receive the annointing oyl from above; next,

This <hi>(as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)</hi> may very well be underſtood, in reſpect of his care and providence concerning out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, a condition which many that are godly are often caſt into: In this reſpect ſhe
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:66021:132"/>ſaith, <hi>my beloved had with drawn himſelf, and was gone.</hi> This condition ſhe fell into for the exerciſe and tryal of her faith: after ſhe had opened to her beloved, and well underſtood the Goſpel. And this complaint ſhe made in <hi>Song third.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where ſhe complaineth of the very ſame condition. Which ſheweth, that ſuch ſort of tryals do often befal the godly in this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable and wretched World; when our beloved Chriſt will ſeem to hide himſelf, and to caſt off all care and regard of us when we are in miſery, that we ſhall have no ſenſe or feeling at all of his love: but will ſeem to be as a ſtranger that hath no relation to us, even as one that hath forgotten all his promiſes. And therefore ſhe complaineth further in the next words.</p>
                  <q>—My Soul failed when he ſpake, I called upon him, and he gave me no anſwer.</q>
                  <p>When he ſpake to me in his promiſes, that no good thing ſhould be wanting, but that all my wants ſhould be ſupplyed, and bid me caſt my care upon him, becauſe he cared for me, <hi>my Soul did even fail, and my confidence was even ſhaken and gone,</hi> becauſe I ſaw that all things were promiſed, but nothing ſeem'd to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd.</p>
                  <p>And further ſhe ſaith, <hi>I call'd upon him and
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:66021:133"/>he gave me no anſwer.</hi> I prayed, and humbled my ſelf much before him, and cryed aloud unto him in my ſad condition; <hi>and yet he gave me no anſwer.</hi> By all which we ſee, that it is no new way of excerciſing the faith of the Church, when the godly are caſt into poverty, reproach and contempt of the world, and when they ſee no way nor means appearing which way to get out. In this condition therefore, muſt we be content to live in, and not to deſpaire of help, whenſoever it ſhall pleaſe our beloved, to exerciſe us in it. This great and ſore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction fell upon the Bride, after ſhe had done her duty faithfully and carefully, for ſhe had opened to her beloved, and her hands had dropped the <hi>Myrrhe:</hi> therefore it was for the tryal of her faith, that ſhe might learn by being exerciſed, not to faint in a ſad condition, but to believe in the promiſes of God, although nothing appeared to reaſon, why ſhe ſhould believe the ſame. According as it is ſaid of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he believed in God, who cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth things that are not, as though they were. Therefore I ſay, this being mark'd out to be the condition of the Church many times, no man muſt take offence at his beloved if he pleaſe to exerciſe his faith this way: but quietly and patiently to depend upon him, and call upon his name. But mark we further what ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth of in this condition.</p>

                  <p>Of theſe the Prophets <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jeremy</hi> do often complain. The Church ſays of theſe, they ſmote her; that is, behind her back, with words of reproach: and wounded her, in her name, credit and reputation.</p>
                  <p>And this bitter temptation the godly ſhall be caſt into by reaſon of the watchmen, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times: of which ſort of people, let all that love God, and their own peace and comfort, learn in time to beware.</p>

                  <p>For even as it was the manner of Harlots to cover their faces with a vail,

                     <hi>(as is to be ſeen in Tamar)</hi> that they might never afterwards be known or appear to be Harlots: So it was the manner of the watchmen, ſo to cover the Church with infamy and reproach, that <hi>(as much as in them lay)</hi> ſhe ſhould never after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards appear to be the Bride. And this ſhe calleth her vail. <hi>And this the keepers of the walls took from her.</hi>

<pb n="253" facs="tcp:66021:134"/>the afflictions of the watchmen, theſe do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to build up the walls of <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> and to pray day and night until ſhe be made a praiſe in the Earth. Theſe keepers took off the vail of reproach,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 59.6</note> that by reaſon of the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men was caſt over the Bride.

                  <p>This being the lot of the Church, every one that is godly muſt expect, that at ſome time or other in his life he ſhall be covered with this vail, although he carry himſelf ever ſo exact and uprightly. The watchmen are in every corner; they go round about the City, <hi>(as David ſpeaks)</hi> and make a noiſe like a Dog: which barketh ſometimes at a very ſhadow, ſometimes becauſe other Dogs bark, but be it for what cauſe it will, the leaſt blemiſh that may be in the Bride, ſets them all a bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Therefore as we muſt expect the vail: So we muſt beware of giving occaſion.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, as we muſt look to be in the condition of the Church, ſo we muſt imitate the practice of the keepers, that ſo when the afflictions of the Bride do become the muſick of the wicked, and when ſhe is covered with great reproach: when the Sons of <hi>Zion</hi> are eſteemed but as earthen pitchers, then we muſt begin to ſet to our Shoulder, and take of the

                  <p>THe Churches vail being taken of by the keepers, ſhe is <hi>ſick of love.</hi> She finding ſo wonderful a deliverance out of ſo bitter a Temptation, is even ſick with joy and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to God. And thus it is with us, when God turneth our Captivity, by his own mighty hand and grace alone, and letteth us ſee, that he caſteth us down into reproach and contempt, for no other end and purpoſe, but to exalt us again by ways unknown, and to magnify his grace and mercy in us: who can chuſe in this condition but be <hi>ſick of love?</hi> And to have his heart enlarged with praiſe and thankfulneſs to his holy name?</p>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:66021:135"/>
                  <p>Now ſhe chargeth the Daughters if they find her beloved to tell him of her ſickneſs. If they find the true Chriſt in the Miniſtry, and alſo in the way of his providence, as ſhe hath done: that they alſo become thankful to him, and praiſe his name, which is her own condition.</p>
                  <p>Now although the charge here be, if they find him, yet this doth not make it a matter of indifference, whether they find him or not, but implies, that they ought to ſeek him ſo as to find him.</p>
                  <p>The Daughters were (no doubt) Miniſters, that bare a great ſway in the viſible Church, for they diſpute much with the bride, and they are often charged by the Bridegroom not to diſturbe her: yet they were ſuch as had not the knowledg of the true Chriſt, as appears alſo by the next Verſe.</p>
                  <p>Now in that they are charged ſo to ſeek, as to find the true Chriſt it ſheweth. That there ought to be a principal care in the Miniſters of the Goſpel, to ſee that the true Chriſt be Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For otherwiſe all men muſt of neceſſity be everlaſtingly loſt. And how ſhall God be glorified in his mercy, or men receive any comfort by Chriſt merits, if Chriſt be never known?

                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:66021:136"/>
                  <p>Which ſheweth us one reaſon, why there is ſo little knowledg of the true Chriſt in the World, it is becauſe there is ſo little care taken in this, that the true Chriſt be Preached. Therefore many ſeek after Chriſt, but few find him: becauſe they ſeek him not aright. With theſe it comes to paſs, even as Chriſt ſaid to the <hi>Jews,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.21.</note>

                        <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.32.</note> They that ſeek him in the Law can never find him: becauſe the true Chriſt is not revealed in the Law. Neither can any man define by the Law what true faith in Chriſt is.</p>
                  <p>The Daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> cry out all upon this, thou muſt do the Law, which all men will grant ought to be done: but to what end and purpoſe works are Commanded, or which way the Law doth further us to faith in Chriſt, this they can ſay nothing to.

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>IT is as much as to ſay, what is the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of faith more then the righteouſneſs of the Law, or wherein lieth the difference? Such is the abominable ignorance of all men, till God open the eyes of the mind: they ſee no difference between Chriſt and <hi>Moſes.</hi> And in this point the Language of the whole earth is confounded: as it was at the building of <hi>Babel.</hi> Thou makeſt a great doe ſay the Daughters, <hi>about thy beloved,</hi> and when all comes to all, <hi>thy beloved is no more then another beloved.</hi> For thou art juſtified by faith we grant, but thy faith muſt be a working faith; otherwiſe thy faith is dead, and not a living faith. Wherein then lies the difference, or <hi>what is thy beloved more then another beloved?</hi> So that in a word the Daughters attribute juſtification to faith, but when they go to define what juſtifying faith is: they can define it no otherwiſe, but to be a working faith. From whence it muſt follow, that he hath will find <hi>the beloved,</hi> muſt find him firſt in his own righteouſneſs or works,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:66021:137"/>which muſt be the form or eſſence of his faith.</p>
                  <p>Alſo it is to be noted here, that when they call the Church <hi>the faireſt among women,</hi> they give unto her the ſame Title that Chriſt doth, but they deny that ſhe hath that righteouſneſs which is eſſential to that Title; which is faith alone. For as was ſaid before, they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand no other faith but a working faith.</p>
                  <p>Therefore how to define that faith which is alone, and to diſtinguiſh it from a working faith they know not. And how can the Bride <hi>be the faireſt amonſt women,</hi> when ſhe wanteth that faith, which uniteth her to Chriſt; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whoſe righteouſneſs <hi>ſhe cannot be fair?</hi> For ſay they, <hi>what is thy beloved more then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beloved?</hi> What doth thy faith avail thee if it hath not works? Can faith ſave thee? Is it not of far leſs worth then that which bringeth forth works? So that although in words they call the Church the faireſt: yet in heart and opinion they own and acknowledg no other righteouſneſs whereby ſhe is purified from her ſin: but the righteouſneſs of the Law, and her own works.</p>
                  <p>Such confuſion the want of underſtanding in this point breedeth, where faith as it is alone and juſtifieth: is not diſtinguiſhed, from faith joined to works, which Sanctifieth. And this moſt horrible confuſion is in the Church amongſt many great Doctors at this day, where this point is not rightly underſtood. For we are
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:66021:137"/>juſtified by faith ſay they, without the works of the Law, but as ſoon as they come to treat of the Law, they will affirm moſt ſtrongly, that without the works of the Law, a man can have no evidence at all of his faith. As if a man were juſtified by faith in the ſight of God; but by works in his Conſcience. Theſe with the Daughters call the bride <hi>the faireſt amongſt women by faith,</hi> but when they come to define what that faith is, they mean no other thing then what is bred and nouriſhed in the bride, by her own works.</p>
                  <p>So that in a word <hi>ſhe is the faireſt:</hi> but by their Doctrine, ſhe is the filthieſt of all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, deſpiſed and condemned of God. Theſe run into a moſt deadly evil through a falſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of faith, for many times the evidence of works is loſt: how then ſhall I be aſſured of my faith? And ſo of Chriſt, and alſo of Everlaſting life? Or elſe muſt I deſpair, and die in unbelief? Such confuſion deſtroyeth the very nature of faith, for faith hath an evidence in it ſelf, and the nature of it is to aſſure,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1.</note> from the light and teſtimony it receiveth from the word of God: it ſpeaketh perſwaſion, as well as it worketh ſanctification, to believe, is not only an act, but ſenſe of faith; So that he that believes, knows that he believes. And it is impoſſible for a man to believe any thing firmly, but he muſt know that he doth believe it: for faith is to receive, and to receive is by
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:66021:138"/>an act of the will, and no man can receive a thing willingly, but he muſt needs know that he doth receive it.</p>
                  <p>Now in that the ſpeech is here doubled by the Daughters, it ſheweth that they were very proud and ſtiff in their opinion. <hi>What is thy beloved,</hi> ſay they, <hi>more then another be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,</hi> that thou doſt ſo charge us? What are we blind? Here although the confuſion be ſo great, that it ſeparateth all men from Chriſt; yet they muſt not be charged with it, nor be thought to err in the leaſt tittle.</p>
                  <p>Such a moſt peſtilent Heritick is mans opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, which will not be contented unleſs it live in the greateſt Hereſy, which ſeparateth all men from Chriſt; and yet it muſt go for the greateſt vertue.</p>
                  <p>Now in the next Verſe, and ſo to the end of this Chapter, in anſwer to the Daughters; the Church ſetteth down the Excellency <hi>of her beloved, beyond any other beloved.</hi>

Therefore when it is ſaid bleſſed are they that do his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that their right may be in the tree of Life, thou muſt underſtand it according to the Goſpel and the firſt Commandment, where by doing his Commandments is meant not depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Law, which opinion in us of ſelf dependance is the firſt thing which is taken away by the Goſpel, and goeth imediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eſtabliſhing in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>All this hinders not, but that the Law is to be done before men to the utmoſt of our power, in the Kingdom of the Law our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience muſt be perſonal, which not withſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing helpeth nothing to righteouſneſs, becauſe it is prevented by faith in Chriſt. Now herein alſo the ſweetneſs of Chriſts mouth is ſeen, in that he teacheth by the Goſpel a new under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Law.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The ſweetneſs of Chriſts mouth is ſeen in this alſo, in that he teacheth the true reaſon of the inſtitution of Sacraments, which in all ages of the Church were to teach faith in Chriſt, Sacraments were not inſtituted to aſſure us that we have faith; or to confirm to us that we do believe, but to aſſure us by a figure of the viſible ground of our faith that we might believe, that our faith might be
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:66021:145"/>Sacramental as well as verbal: that we might learn the miſtery of our faith by and from the figure.</p>
                  <p>Thus by Circumciſion God did eſtabliſh his <hi>Covenant</hi> with <hi>Abraham</hi> to be his God,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7.</note> and the God of his ſeed, and why was this? But only from the figure to teach him to believe. And when circumciſion is ſaid to be a Seal of the righteouſneſs of faith, it is,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.</note> becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth by a figure the righteouſneſs which faith layeth hold upon.</p>
                  <p>And under the figure of the Paſſover they were taught to believe their deliverance,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.13.</note> from ſin and the wrath of God by the blood of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>So the reaſon why Baptiſm was inſtituted, was to manifeſt Chriſt unto <hi>Iſrael,</hi> John 1.31. It looketh not upon the worthineſs of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but teacheth to behold our unworthineſs that we may be made worthy in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>So the Lords Supper,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.</note> was inſtituted to fulfil the Paſſover and ſhew us the Lords death, that we might have a viſible, and Sacramental ground to believe that he is crucified and riſen for us. Now theſe being the cauſes why Sacraments were inſtituted it is proving and not to be proved: therefore no unworthineſs in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects muſt be alleaged to bar their priviledg, that ſtands in oppoſition to the reaſons of their inſtitution. So that we ſee Chriſts mouth is ſweet in that he openeth theſe three points, the ground of our faith, the ſenſe of the Law,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:66021:146"/>and the reaſon of the inſtitution of Sacraments. Which I conceive are the three gates ſpoken of <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. which pertain to the holy City new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> on the <hi>Eaſt, Weſt, North,</hi> and <hi>South</hi> ſide of the Heavenly City, without the opening of which three gates there is no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the new <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> For let the ground of faith be ever ſo well opened, which is the firſt gate, if the terms of the Law be not alſo opened, and the ſignification made known, no man can enter, for the Law will be a ſtumbling block to his faith and keep him out. But admit this gate be alſo opened, if the third be ſhut, the reaſon why Sacraments were inſtituted, no man can paſs into the City. For if the Sacraments belong not to me before I am worthy, then is the ground of my faith which is the firſt gate ſhut again, then alſo is the firſt Commandment, and the ſenſe of the whole Law, which is the ſecond gate alſo ſhut: Nay then are all the gates kept faſt lock'd up, that no paſſenger can paſs into the holy City new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for evermore, but muſt remain without, and ſuffer the loſs of Eternal life, and happineſs. Conſider of theſe things with wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and ſee whether his mouth be not moſt ſweet, and whether he be not altogether lovely, as the bride here ſingeth.</p>
                  <p>And when ſhe ſaith, <hi>this is my beloved, and my friend;</hi> ſhe ſheweth the Daughters what the true Preaching of the Goſpel is, and that where this order and method is not obſerved,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:66021:146"/>Chriſt is very little known, or regarded. Therefore ſhe ſaith, he that thus Preacheth the Goſpel is my friend. This is the beautiful perſon that bringeth the glad tidings of peace and good things.</p>
                  <p>This is the interpreter one of a thouſand, O ye Daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> and the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of ten thouſand unto me, for although I had ten thouſand inſtructers, yet this is the Doctrine which begetteth, and preſerveth me in Chriſt, and in this Doctrine will I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce.</p>

                  <p>AFTER the Bride had ſet forth the praiſes, of her beloved in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Chapter, and the benefits that ſhe receiveth from him through faith alone: the Daughters, in ſtead of receiving of him, make this enquiry, <hi>whether is thy beloved gone?</hi> When the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven is brought near, even to the very dores, as it is whereſoever Chriſt is truly Preached, yet the Daughters know not how to faſten upon him by faith alone, but imagine to find him ſome other way.</p>
                  <p>In ſtead of embracing the true Chriſt, which is preſent to faith: they ſeek after an imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inary Chriſt, which is to be found <hi>(as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)</hi> in the works of the Law. So great an enemy is carnal reaſon to faith, that it cannot
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:66021:147"/>endure to receive any thing from God: but ſtill dreameth to bring ſomething to him firſt, thinking thereby to procure acceptance with him.</p>
                  <p>So that this queſtion, <hi>whether is thy beloved gone?</hi> Sheweth their ignorance in the faith, and knowledg of the Son of God. And this is the miſery of all men, until God openeth the eyes of their underſtanding; that when Chriſt is preached, and nothing is wanting but only faith to receive him, then to dream of a Chriſt, that we think may be found in the Law. Which is no better, then to forſake that Doctrine and Religion, which bindeth us to Chriſt that is come: and to caſt our ſelves under the prophecy of a Chriſt to come, which Chriſt is no where to be found.</p>
                  <p>We muſt therefore believe, that where the true Goſpel is preached, Chriſt is not gone but come, there he is preſent, and no where elſe to be found; which muſt alſo quicken our underſtandings, to ſeek him in the Goſpel, and ſtop our imaginations from ſeeking after him in the works of the Law.</p>
                  <p>Note alſo here, that the daughters give the Bride the Title, <hi>of the faireſt among women,</hi> and yet affirm, that ſhe is too ſeeking <hi>of her beloved,</hi> which is a plain contradiction. For if ſhe be the faireſt, then it is becauſe the righteouſneſs of Chriſt is imputed to her whereby ſhe is made fair: but if ſhe be yet too ſeeking <hi>of her beloved,</hi> then ſhe remaineth
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:66021:148"/>without the righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed, and abideth in her filthineſs, under the Law and condemnation.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the Daughters when they call <hi>her the faireſt amongſt women,</hi> affirm, (nothing leſs, <hi>then that ſhe is made ſo by faith alone:)</hi> the principal cauſe thereof to be her own right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs the works of the Law. It is agreed between them, that it is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt alone, that maketh righteous perſons in the ſight of God: but the difference lieth in this, whether it be the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, inherent in himſelf and imputed to faith, or the righteouſneſs of Chriſt communicated, whereby good works are wrought to become righteouſneſs before God? The Bride ſaith, it is by his righteouſneſs imputed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in drawing the benefits of Chriſt into the Conſcience, ſhe teacheth faith alone: The Daughters ſay, it is by his righteouſneſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, therefore in teaching the Goſpel, they always reprove an idle faith, and require a working faith.</p>
                  <p>The Daughters do not deny the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of faith, according as they define faith, which is, to believe the Hiſtory of Chriſts ſufferings, and that there is an all ſufficiency in them, to ſatisfy Divine Juſtice, if they make them their own: but ſay they, thou art yet wanting in this, until thou findeſt ſome thing inherent in thy ſelf which muſt evidence thy faith to be true.</p>
                  <pb n="281" facs="tcp:66021:148"/>
                  <p>Therefore, thou muſt further ſeek after thy beloved, to have an evidence from thy works, to witneſs thy faith. So that all they do, upon the matter is but this, to give her a name to live: but by their principles they judg her to be dead.</p>
                  <p>For they tell her that ſhe is not compleatly juſtified, becauſe the righteouſneſs of Chriſt is but begun in her: She wanteth the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Law to make it perfect. For whether is thy beloved gone ſay they? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is thy beloved turn'd aſide, that we may ſeek him with thee? Thou haſt loſt thy beloved by thy faith, if thou defineſt faith after no other manner. Therefore leave off thy ſtrange definition of faith, that we may ſeek him with thee, and let us be unanimous in matters of love and good works, and let ſuch niceties alone in matters of faith. So that the Daughters in this place, do not only take away from the Bride, the white raiment, the pure righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt, whereby ſhe is cloathed from the wrath of God: and leave her in her own filthineſs as in the day of her Nativity, but alſo, they take away from Chriſt, his name, his office and glory: making of Chriſt, in ſtead of a Juſtifier and Saviour, nothing but a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of ſin, and condemnation. According to St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his allegations againſt the falſe Apoſtles, If while we ſeek to be made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous by Chriſt, we our ſelves are yet found ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that is, have need of the righteouſneſs
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:66021:149"/>of the Law, to evidence or perfect our faith, without which evidence, we remain yet ſinners and unjuſtified, then Chriſt is nothing to us but a Miniſter of ſin, for then have we no more by Chriſt, then by the Law, which is life if we keep it, but death if we break it.</p>
                  <p>This ſpeech of the Daughters, is the true picture of what manner of Preachers there ſhall be in ſome places of the Church in all ages, even ſuch that ſhall ſpeak of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt, and much extol the ſame: but nothing in compariſon of the righteouſneſs of the Law. That although they lay down the righteouſneſs of Chriſt to a Conſcience in diſtreſs, upon no other ground but that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth, yet they ſhall with the Daughters, underſtand faith after no other manner, nor teach the principles of it any otherwiſe, but by requiring the works of the Law: accounting the chief beloved to be wanting until that righteouſneſs be had. For ſay they, the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that Chriſt came into the world for was to Redeem us from our Sins, and this Redemption is ours by faith, but when they come to define, what this faith is: they can teach no other definition of it, but a mans actual conformity to the Law of God. And therefore by their Doctrine and manner of teaching, they require nothing but only a ſtrict conformity to Gods Law, that ſo an evidence may be had of faith in Chriſt.</p>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:66021:149"/>
                  <p>This is with the Daughters, to call the Bride the faireſt amongſt women by reaſon of her faith; and yet to hide the righteouſneſs of Chriſt from the Conſcience whereby ſhe is made fair.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, if a man muſt have the righteouſneſs of Chriſt and of the Law both before he can be juſtified before God, and have any aſſurance of it in his Conſcience: why do they not then preſcribe a meaſure, how far a man muſt go in matter of works, before he can be aſſured that his faith is true, that ſo a man may know when his labour is at an end?</p>
                  <p>That manner of Doctrine reproveth not unbelief, but eſtabliſheth in man an opinion of his works, and plainly ſheweth: that our inherent righteouſneſs (contrary to St.
<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Paul</hi>) and not our confeſſed unrighteouſneſs doth commend the righteouſneſs of God.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are they whoſe Doctrine ends in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, who confeſs the Bride in word to be the faireſt amongſt women by faith alone, but in deed and in truth, that even then, ſhe is too ſeeking of her beloved. For whether ſay they, is thy beloved gone that we may ſeek him with thee? To which it is anſwered by the Bride in the next verſe as followeth.</p>

<pb n="286" facs="tcp:66021:151"/>as this faith of application remaineth. And when it is ſaid, <hi>he feedeth among the Lillies;</hi> ſhe meaneth, with this faith of application, which is rich feeding by which he feedeth all that are his, againſt the fear of death and all evil, unto Eternal life.</p>
                  <p>With this argument alſo, muſt we learn to overcome, when the Conſcience is in fear and diſtreſs by reaſon of any adverſary.
<note place="margin">

                  <p>This foundation will never fail us, becauſe we ground our faith from a principle that is true.

                  <p>Therefore, when thou art in miſery and knoweſt not what to do, be thy calamity what it will, begin thy faith, where God begins to thee. But thou wilt ſay, how is that? I anſwer,

When thou haſt learned thus to ground thy faith, and to make applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Goſpel: then ſhalt thou eaſily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and find by thine own experience, the meaning of that Text, I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not, and lead them in paths that they have not known. Foraſmuch as the common way that is known, is, that firſt we muſt pleaſe God, before he will own and accept of us: but the way which is not known, and that God reveals, is, that he loveth and owneth us firſt, teacheth us, to be diſpleaſed with our ſelves, and ſo maketh us a people for his glory. This is the way of the Lord, and thus he feedeth his Lillies: and they that well taſt hereof, are nouriſhed up in peace and comfort.</p>
                  <p>With this one argument thou mayeſt drive the <hi>Divel</hi> and all his inſtruments into Hell from whence they came.</p>

Theſe are ſaid to be three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore, which is an indefinite ſpeech: meaning, there are multitudes of them. And they are all Queens, that is, in their own conceit and imaginations, they all think themſelves ſo to be. The opinion of them all is ſet down in <hi>Eſai.</hi> 47. <hi>I am and none elſe.</hi> And in <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. <hi>I ſit a Queen, and am no widow.</hi> The meaning I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive is this. I am the only Bride or Queen of Chriſt, and there is none elſe, but only thoſe of my way, and this is the opinion of every Sect. And their opinion is not only ſet down, but alſo the reaſon of it, <hi>I am no widow.</hi> Now to be a widow cannot be until the Husband be dead:
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.</note> but when the Husband is dead, the woman is a widow.</p>
                  <p>And ſhe that calleth her ſelf a Queen,
<note place="margin">They that glory in the Law are condemned by the Law.</note> is the Church in her own eſteem, and her Husband is the Law. And in that ſhe glorieth in her married condition, it ſheweth, ſhe is not dead to the Law, but under the dominion and power
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:66021:154"/>of the Law. So that I am no widow, is as much as to ſay, I am not divorced from, nor dead in reſpect of the Law: but I dilligently follow the works of the Law, therefore am I the true ſpouſe, or Queen of Chriſt. The ſum is, ſhe boaſteth in the righteouſneſs of the Law; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (as ſhe ſuppoſeth) ſhe walketh accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Law, which is the opinion of every Sect.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Concubines</hi> are thoſe that do not make a local ſeparation from the Church, but live in viſible communion with her: yet have no part nor ſhare in the inheritance of God.

Becauſe ſhe truſteth in the wickedneſs of her own opinion: therefore her own opinion ſhall condemn her. By all which we ſee, that although the Queens and Concubines are the only righteous perſons in their own eyes: yet ſhe that mourneth for her ſins, is the only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent creature in Chriſts ſight. And why is ſhe ſo excellent? Even becauſe ſhe preſenteth her ſelf before him not a righteous perſon but a ſinner, by her principles, and asketh forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſame.

For <hi>Sarah</hi> the freewoman (<hi>which</hi> Paul <hi>is there treating of</hi>) was the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and a type of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: which <hi>Iſaac</hi> was born by promiſe. For <hi>Abraham</hi> had <hi>Iſaac</hi> by <hi>Sarah,</hi> and he had alſo <hi>Iſhmael</hi> by <hi>Hagar</hi> his <hi>Concubine.</hi> Both theſe Sons were born in <hi>Abrahams</hi> Family which was the viſible Church of God. <hi>Iſaac</hi> was born by promiſe: but <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was born without the promiſe of God.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Abrahams</hi> Family then, there are the two Teſtaments, and a twofold Mother. The one is <hi>Agar</hi> (figuring the Law) which <hi>(being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the promiſe of God)</hi> gendereth all her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren unto bondage. The other is <hi>Sarah</hi> which is called the freewoman, being a type of the true Church, which giveth the Goſpel freely, without the works of the Law.</p>

                  <p>She that after this manner gendereth Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren unto God, is the only one of her Mother. The <hi>Concubine</hi> is without this praiſe, becauſe ſhe gendereth from <hi>Sina:</hi> therefore is ſhe under the curſe and wrath of God. Now as <hi>Iſaac</hi> is the heir becauſe he is born by promiſe; So the Children of the freewoman, are the only Sons and heirs of God by Adoption. And as <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was a ſervant, caſt out of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Family, and never to have any ſhare in the inheritance with <hi>Iſaac:</hi> So the Law only maketh men ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, ſubject to the wrath of God, and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth them from the glorious inheritance of the Saints for evermore.</p>
                  <p>Let us learn then ſo to underſtand the Goſpel that we may become Children of the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, which thou canſt not do, unleſs thou renounce the bondwoman and her Son. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when thy Conſcience is in diſtreſs, and thou feeleſt thy ſelf to be in bondage, under the curſe of the Law and wrath of God; and thou beginneſt to humble thy ſelf before him, ſtop thine ears then from hearing the Law, either for what thou haſt done, or what thou oughteſt to have done, and hearken only to the comfortable voice of the promiſe: which ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing but grace and mercy, to a poor Creature that feeleth his miſery, and ſuffer the ſame to make an impreſſion within thee. Then ſhalt thou have a certain feeling within thy ſelf, that although thou art defiled in thine own eyes, becauſe thou haſt broken thy bounds;
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:66021:157"/>yet that thou art undefiled in the ſight of thy beloved, in regard thou receiveſt grace and mercy from him.</p>
                  <q>—The Daughters ſaw her, and bleſſed her, yea, the Queens and the Concubines, and they praiſed her.</q>
                  <p>To bleſs in Scripture ſometimes ſignifies to juſtify,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1, 2.</note> ſo God bleſſeth us when he juſtifieth us. But a man may be ſaid to juſtify another, when he followeth the practice of another. Thus <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is ſaid to juſtifie her Siſters, <hi>Samaria,</hi> and <hi>Sodom,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eze.</hi> 16.</note> by following their abominations. And this I underſtand in another ſenſe to be the meaning here by the Daughters bleſſing, and the Queens and Concubines praiſing the Bride. Which is, they followed the practice of the Bride. They do not condemn, but bleſs or juſtify the practice of the Bride. But it may be ſaid in what? I anſwer, in ſeeking after a Chriſt. All manner of <hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> do ſeek after a Chriſt: but not after the true Chriſt. There is a great difference in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after a Chriſt, and the Chriſt: A Saviour all people ſeek after, <hi>(every man maketh unto himſelf ſome God or other.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.32.</note> 
                     <hi>Make us Gods to go before us ſay the people to Aaron)</hi> but few there are, that ſeek after the Saviour. The <hi>Iſralites</hi> ſought after a Chriſt, when they ſought him in the works of the Law, but could never find
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:66021:157"/>him:
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.32.</note> 
                     <hi>but the Gentiles which ſought him by faith without the works of the Law, found the Chriſt.</hi> And in this ſenſe it is ſaid, I was found of them that ſought me not.</p>
                  <p>Now if the Queens and Concubines do bleſs and praiſe themſelves, <hi>(as in heart they do)</hi> in ſeeking after a Chriſt; then they do alſo bleſs and praiſe the Bride in ſeeking after the Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Alſo if it be good in them, <hi>(as in their opinion it is good)</hi> to ſeek for a Chriſt: then it is alſo good and very good in the bride, to ſeek for the Chriſt, which is the true Chriſt indeed. They all agree in word,
<note place="margin">It is the duty of all men to live in obedience to the Law, but to ſeek for a Chriſt in the Law is to deny the Goſpel.</note> 
                     <hi>that Jeſus is the true Chriſt,</hi> but the Queſtion is, how to ſeek him ſo as to find him? The <hi>Queens</hi> and <hi>Concubines</hi> ſay, thou muſt live in an active conformity to the Law of God, then ſhalt thou have an evidence of thy faith in Chriſt: but the Bride ſaith, in the firſt place thou muſt ſeek him by faith without the Law, otherwiſe thou muſt die in thy ſins. For ſo ſaith Chriſt to the <hi>Jews, ye ſhall ſeek me, and not find me,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.</note> 
                     <hi>and ſhall die in your ſins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This ſheweth us the reaſon why the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the <hi>Queens</hi> and <hi>Concubines</hi> are ſo earneſt in preſſing the works of the Law, why they require it of neceſſity under the penalty of Everlaſting damnation: and alſo why they are ſo rigid, ſo ſevere, and look ſo loftily upon thoſe poor Creatures, that have groſly broken the Law, as if they themſelves were made of
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:66021:158"/>purer metal, the reaſon is, becauſe they ſeek for a Chriſt in the Law.</p>
                  <p>And alſo it ſheweth us, why the godly can ſubmit, give place to all, do not count them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for a rule, for all men to conform unto, <hi>(in reſpect of their outward carriage)</hi> but are willing to yeild, to obey, not to ſeparate themſelves from ſinners, but to equalize them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the worſt: to ſhew kindneſs and reſpect to all, to friends and foes, good and bad, worthy and unworthy, on purpoſe to gain their hearts, and win their affections <hi>(if it be poſſible)</hi> to love and embrace the Goſpel, the reaſon is, becauſe they have found thee Chriſt, the true <hi>Meſſias,</hi> without the Law.</p>
                  <p>Hence it comes to paſs, that when the Daughters come to die, <hi>(for want of a right underſtanding in this point)</hi> and ſin begins to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the Conſcience, they know not how to faſten upon any one promiſe, nor to pray with any manner of confidence, but are even forc'd to cry out with thoſe that had crucified the Lord of life,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37.</note> 
                     <hi>men and brethren what ſhall we do to be ſaved?</hi> All this comes to paſs, becauſe they have ſpent all their time in ſeeking for a Chriſt, a ſuppoſed, an imaginary Chriſt, but none for the Chriſt, which is the true Chriſt indeed: According to S. <hi>Paul, The Gentiles which followed not righteouſneſs, have attained to righteouſneſs, even the righteouſneſs of faith: but</hi> Iſrael <hi>which followed after righteouſneſs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.30.</note> 
                     <hi>have not attained to the law of righteouſneſs, becauſe they
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:66021:158"/>ſought it not by faith, but in the works of the law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore ſeeing Chriſt ſaith here, <hi>That the daughters bleſſed her;</hi> alſo <hi>that the Queens and Concubines by their practiſe praiſed her,</hi> in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after a Chriſt, which they ſought only in the works of the law, and therefore they could not find him: Let us learn rightly to ſeek after Chriſt by faith, that ſo when we ſeek him, we may not ſeek him in vain.</p>

                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.</note> 
                     <hi>the greater light to rule the Day, and the leſſer light to rule the night:)</hi> For
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:66021:159"/>although the Moon hath her defects and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, ſometimes increaſeth, and is ſometimes more obſcure, appearing in divers forms and figures in the Firmament; yet is ſhe a Planet created to rule the Night. Therefore the Bride is here likened to the Moon, becauſe ſhe is ſet to give light upon the Earth; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by the light that ſhe giveth, ſhe is to rule the Night. She giveth not her own light upon the earth which ſhe hath naturally; but a borrowed light which ſhe receiveth from the Sun the Fountain of light, which light ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth into the midſt of darkneſs to expel the ſame: for although for a time the light of the Moon may be hidden, yet as ſoon as ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, the darkneſs expels.</p>
                  <p>Now in that the light of this heavenly Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net is from the Sun the Fountain of Light, and that the light which ſhe receiveth is to rule the Night, it ſheweth us what the proper Office of the Goſpel is, even to ſhine in our hearts, and to comfort us in a dark condition. This light is the Nativity of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who was born at <hi>Bethlem,</hi> which Nativity is given unto us by our hearing and receiving the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Therefore when thou feeleſt thy ſelf to be in darkneſs, and mightily oppreſſed with the ſhadows of the Night, make haſt into thy Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, and ſay; Lord, I am in great affliction and ſore diſtreſs, and have juſtly deſerved by my ſin to periſh in the darkneſs I am in; but
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:66021:160"/>ſeeing thou haſt ordained, that I ſhall live be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee by a borrowed light, even by my Lord Jeſus Chriſt who was born at <hi>Bethlem,</hi> where the glad-tidings of great joy were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by the heavenly Angel, grant therefore that I may believe the Meſſage of the Angel, that ſo I may receive the whole benefit. At the very firſt time thou beginneſt to practice after this manner, and feeleſt thy heart any whit warmed with the apprehenſion of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Babe, that's the very day and hour that Chriſt is born in thee: Then art thou become <hi>fair as the Moon,</hi> and yet thou haſt the Moon under thy feet; foraſmuch as all thy defects and obſcurities, changes and alterations, which made thee appear like the Moon in her weakeſt condition; yet now being cloathed with the Sun, thou deſpiſeſt them all. When once thou underſtandeſt theſe things aright, then mayeſt thou ariſe and ſhine by thy borrowed light, and ſhall experimentally feel that of Chriſt, which thou thy ſelf wilt ſay, thou kneweſt not before.</p>
                  <q>—Clear as the Sun—</q>
                  <p>This is meant in reſpect of her Doctrine, which is ſaid to be clear as Chryſtal; for as the Sun is the Fountain of Light natural, ſo is Chriſt the Fountain of Light ſpiritual, and Son of righteouſneſs; which being made known to the world, maketh a great light. By this light
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:66021:160"/>every man that believeth, his Conſcience is acquitted from the wrath of God, and alſo is made to ſee the vanity of his ways, and is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from a vain mind. By this light he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth wherein the errours of all men lie, is made a Judge of all things, yet he himſelf is judged of no man.</p>
                  <q>—Terrible as an Army with Banners.</q>
                  <p>This Doctrine is terrible to the blind world, and to the whole kingdom of Satan, that it battereth all in pieces, even as an Army doth with Banners: For there is no Sect nor Hereſie upon the face of the earth, that can ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Goſpel; let the caſe be rightly ſtated, and the true ſtate of the buſineſs ſtuck unto on both ſides, and either he that oppoſeth it muſt fly, or elſe he muſt turn and be converted. Therefore it is ſaid of the Day of the Lord, <hi>that it ſhall burn as an Oven,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.</note> 
                     <hi>and ſhall burn up all the proud of the earth, and leave neither root nor branch.</hi> The Goſpel plucketh up the root of all Hereſies, and with the root the branch; foraſmuch as the principal matter whereupon all Hereticks and Sects build their confidence, is the very firſt thing which the Goſpel deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. Therefore the Goſpel is a moſt terrible Doctrine to all the wicked of the earth: but moſt ſweet and pleaſant to all thoſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form unto it. And therefore Chriſt ſays, <hi>I came to ſend fire upon the earth, and what is my
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:66021:161"/>deſire but that it be kindled?</hi> Therefore no man muſt be afraid to maintain the Goſpel, for fear of the diſpleaſure of men, (for that is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſt, and flatter all men into Hell) but every man according to his ability muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to defend the ſame.</p>

                     <pb n="307" facs="tcp:66021:161"/>it meaneth, to learn how to be afflicted for her ſin, and how to become low in her own eyes, like the Valley; and alſo how to be healed and exalted through the righteouſneſs of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that ſhe might rejoyce in the fruits of the Miniſtry. The ſum of the whole Verſe I conceive is this: That the main and principal buſineſs that concerns thoſe that are Preachers and Hearers of the Word of God, in frequenting publick Aſſemblies; is, to teach and to learn how to make and to heal again tender and afflicted conſciences. How to lay men low in their own eyes, that they may lament in ſecret for their ſins; and how to bind them up, and heal them with the righteouſneſs of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: For this cauſe the Bride went down into the <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> to learn this heavenly Art and divine Skill. Where this learning is not taught, little is ſaid, and where this is not heard, little is learned. If the conſcience ſhould be afflicted and not healed again, it would fall into deſpair; or if a Plaiſter ſhould be provided where there is no ſore, no man would eſteem it, therefore the Church learneth both theſe points.</p>
                  <p>And the reaſon why this is the principal thing, is, becauſe this manner of learning ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth perſons new, it maketh men righteous before God, and alſo righteous before men: It maketh the Tree good, and his Fruit good; otherwiſe, where it is not taught, it leaveth the Tree evil, and his Fruit evil.</p>
                  <pb n="308" facs="tcp:66021:162"/>
                  <p>This ſheweth us the reaſon, why <hi>(in many places)</hi> the labour of the Miniſtry is ſo impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, why there is ſo little good done by Preaching, and ſo little benefit received by hearing, but men go away from Church aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies as cold and blockiſh as ever they were, the reaſon is, becauſe the drift and ſcope of their manner of handling the word of God, tendeth not to the making and healing again of tender and afflicted Conſciences, but bendeth quite another way.</p>
                  <p>Hence they all call for doing of the Law, which neither maketh the wound, nor healeth the ſore. And from this alſo it comes to paſs, that if any man comes into the Garden and deſireth for a kernel, he findeth but a ſhell, and in ſtead of making valleys, ſetting up of Mountains: the reaſon is, becauſe the true way to life is hid; which to think on aright may cauſe a Lamentation, in that there is ſo little underſtood in this point, which is the only thing and foundation whereupon all our happineſs doth depend.</p>
                  <p>Let all men therefore learn to humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for their wants in this thing, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly beg of God that his word may be purely taught. Where this knowledg is not, little fruit appears in the Valley, the Vine flouriſheth not there, but the miſerable Conſcience is ſhut up in Priſon and darkneſs; but where this ſpiritual skill is learn'd, there and there only,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:66021:162"/>the <hi>Pomegranates</hi> do bud, and a wonderful and ſuddain change is made, according as it here followeth.</p>

                  <q>—What will ye ſee in the Shulamite? as it were the Company of two Armies.</q>
                  <p>Theſe words I conceive to be the voice of Chriſt, and it is as much as to ſay, that which thou wouldeſt ſee in the <hi>Shulamite,</hi> thou canſt not; for in the <hi>Shulamite</hi> there are two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of Prophets, are Preachers of the word, and they band themſelves one againſt the other, like two Armies. And the difference between them is, <hi>(the caſe being rightly ſtated)</hi> about this one Queſtion. Which is the proving principle in the Scriptures? Whether the Law muſt be expounded by the Goſpel, or the Goſpel expounded ſo as it may accord with the Law?</p>
                  <p>The anſwering of this Queſtion,
<note place="margin">The extent of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of all Heriticks, Sects, and Seducers, being right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they will be found to claſh againſt the Goſpel in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> endeth all controverſies in the Church. Foraſmuch as all differences about Religion do Center in this point. Hence it is, that what is affirmed by the one overthrows the Law in the matter of juſtification: and what is affirmed by the other, overthrows the Goſpel in the ſame point. For
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:66021:164"/>when the Bride defineth faith to be a believing in Chriſt without works, <hi>(only becauſe of God the promiſer)</hi> totally excluding the Law; the <hi>Shulamite (and all others that are enemies to the Goſpel)</hi> do define faith, to be a believing in Chriſt by reaſon of works, totally excluding the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Now to decide this controverſy, it muſt be noted, that the firſt principles <hi>(as is ſhewed elſewhere in this Song)</hi> are proving, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all other Scriptures muſt be expounded by them.
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Song</hi> 3.10.</note> And that as the firſt principle in Divinity is the Scriptures,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.4.</note> ſo the firſt principle in the Scriptures is the Goſpel <hi>(or the firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment which drives us to the Goſpel, which comes all to one)</hi> for the firſt word of all is, <hi>hear O Iſrael I am the Lord thy God:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mark.</hi> 12.29.</note> which words are the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Wherein God bindeth himſelf to us, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any thing of ours: then follows the firſt Commandment,
<note place="margin">This point rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood draweth us into the practiſe of all good works, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it unbindeth us from the rigour of the Law, and filleth the mind and Conſcience with the love of God, which is the ground of all obedience.</note> which prohibites our depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon any other righteouſneſs but the righteouſneſs of God, ſet before us in the Goſpel. And alſo forbids all ſuch definitions of faith, and all ſuch interpretations of the Law, which ſtrengthen in man an opinion of the Law and works.</p>
                  <pb n="313" facs="tcp:66021:164"/>
                  <p>Now the Goſpel being the firſt word and proving principle, therefore ſuch a ſenſe muſt be found of all thoſe Scriptures, that promiſe juſtification to mans Active doing of the Law, as may be ſuitable to the Goſpel, and mortify mans opinion of the Law and works. But thou wilt ſay, how ſhall I do that? I anſwer, doing in Divinity hath <hi>(by reaſon of the Goſpel)</hi> a new ſignification, which is to juſtify God, and is not to be underſtood <hi>(when juſtification is promiſed to it)</hi> of a moral doing, but of ſuch a ſpiritual paſſive doing which is incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to mans reaſon, whereby thou ſubmitteſt to the wrath of the Law, and flyeſt from it by faith to Chriſt, who createth in thee a new opinion of the Law, which is to walk in the works thereof without dependance upon them: which obedience <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth thee to call, a ſerving in newneſs of Spirit. And thus mayeſt thou eaſily give an anſwer to all oppoſers of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, this muſt alſo comfort us when we are in great tribulations, when we are in doubt of his care and providence in reſpect of outward things, or any way perplexed with the fear of Gods wrath: For then will the Law begin to work in us after this manner, theſe things thou haſt done, and thou canſt not deny it, and therefore thy judgment is juſt, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall appear before thine eyes which way
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:66021:165"/>thy fears ſhall be prevented: now in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition if thou expoundeſt the Goſpel according to the Law, then ſhall thy faith be overwhelmed, and only the Law ſhall reign, but if thou haſt learned this Divine and Heavenly Art to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the Law by the Goſpel, then ſhall the Law vaniſh out of thy Conſcience, and Chriſt alone ſhall rule and govern.</p>
                  <p>Therefore in ſuch a condition as this, enter into thy cloſet and pray after this manner, <hi>Lord,</hi> I am in great diſtreſs and know not what to do, and the evils that I fear are juſtly coming upon me, <hi>by reaſon of my ſin:</hi> and if I ſhould now expound the Goſpel by the Law which is now upon me, then ſhould I be totally ruined without all hope of recovery, but ſeeing thou haſt taught me to expound the Law by the Goſpel, and not to make conſtruction of things according to ſenſe and reaſon: but according to thy holy and gracious promiſe, teach me to ſtick unto it ſo long as life ſhall laſt.</p>
                  <p>When once thou entereſt into this excerciſe of thy faith thou wilt quickly find the ſweet of it, and wilt not care a ruſh for any affliction. Then ſhalt thou experimently feel in thy ſelf, that although there be in the <hi>Shulamite,</hi> as it were, the company of two armies, the fleſh war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit warring againſt the fleſh, inwardly againſt the accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:66021:165"/>and terrors of the Law, and outwardly againſt falſe Prophets and Seducers: yet that thou mayeſt eaſily overcome them by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. And alſo ſhalt find, that this Battel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to paſs, from the principles of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: but from the natures of men, who by reaſon of blindneſs and wilfulneſs will not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the ſame.</p>

                  <p>The joints then are here commended in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their uſe and Office: which is to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter nouriſhment from the head to the reſt of the body. Theſe joints are the particular Members in the Church: which <hi>are like jewels,</hi> being wonderful precious in the eſtimation of the owner. Where theſe joints do rightly perform their Office, the body groweth ſtrong: <hi>(but where there is a coldneſs and benumendneſs in the joints, the body groweth lame, and little agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity will be ſeen,)</hi> and there alſo are the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grooms jewels.

                  <p>Next, theſe are ſaid to be the <hi>work of the hands of a cunning Artificer.</hi> By the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer I underſtand the Preacher of the Goſpel, who is skilful in forming or planting Chriſt in the Soul. Who is able through the holy Ghoſt to teach a right diviſion between the Law and Goſpel in uſe and practice: that Chriſt may rule in the Conſcience, and the Law may go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the old man, which cannot be done but by the hand <hi>of a cunning workman.</hi> This is he that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, when he ſays a workman that needeth not to be aſhamed, dividing the word of truth aright; where this skilful Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer is, the Conſcience is kept pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled: but where there is daubing with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered Morter, the Conſcience is often out of joint. Therefore he that is the Artificer muſt be a cunning workman, that knoweth how to break the ſtone in the heart by the hammer of the Law: and alſo how to bind up the broken hearted by the Goſpel without the Law. Where this Artificer is, nouriſhment is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed from the head into the body, and every part is ſupplyed, as it were, by joints and bands to the edifying of it ſelf in love: there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing done but the framing and faſhioning of Jewels for the Lord, and the preſenting <hi>(as it were)</hi> of a Royal Diadem into the hands of God. Therefore it is ſaid of the holy City the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that it is all of pure gold, and that it is garniſhed with all manner of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:66021:168"/>Stones: which is the buſineſs of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eller to garniſh the City.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, ſeeing he is to work in Gold and Silver, and precious Stones, even with the pure Doctrine of the Goſpel, ſeeing he muſt break in pieces ſtony hearts, and grind them as it were to powder, and alſo muſt ſet in order poor diſtreſſed Conſciences, that are altogether out of joint, that they may be armed and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified againſt ſo mighty an enemy as the Devil: he had <hi>need be a cunning workman,</hi> a wiſe Maſter builder, that is able ſo to build as the building may ſtand.</p>
                  <p>This is the Artificer ſpoken of here by the Bridegroom, whoſe Office is ſo to Preach the Goſpel, that nouriſhment may be conveyed from the head Chriſt Jeſus, into the Church which is his body: that ſo from joint to joint, every member may be ſupplyed, and the whole body may increaſe with the increaſings of God.</p>

                  <p>THe navel is that whereby ſhe nouriſheth her Children in the Conſcience, which is the womb of the Church. For ſhe is here ſet forth under the ſimilitude of a Child-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing woman,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1.</note> therefore <hi>ſhe is ſaid by Saint</hi> Paul <hi>to be the Mother of us all, and the Miniſters of the Church to be ſpiritual Fathers.</hi> And in that her <hi>navel is like a round Goblet that is full,</hi> it ſheweth her ſtore of Heavenly proviſion to nouriſh her Children in the womb: and that ſhe is able to teach a right conceaving of Chriſt in the mind and Conſcience. The drift and ſcope of all her teaching is, how to unbottom the Soul from it ſelf, and to graft it into the Lord Jeſus Chriſt by faith: that ſo being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered out of Priſon, and ſet in liberty and freedom, it may joyfully walk in the practice of all good works. And in this ſhe differeth from the Mother-in-Law, or Bondwoman, who although ſhe teacheth alſo a neceſſity of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, calling it the one thing needful, which all muſt have or elſe be damned, yet ſhe teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no other way to attain unto it, but only by an earneſt preſſing and requiring of good
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:66021:169"/>works, and thereupon ſhe promiſeth her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren the aſſurance of juſtification and bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. She nouriſheth not her Children in the womb, but deſtroyeth the conception; becauſe ſhe teacheth not the true way to attain to that Righteouſneſs and Holineſs which is required. For ſhe endeavoureth firſt to make the fruit good, and then the Tree good: but the true Mother firſt endeavoureth to make the Tree good, and then the fruit good. This ſheweth us the reaſon, why there are ſo few Children in the Church of God that come to good, why there is ſo much teaching and little the near: the reaſon is becauſe there are ſo few that are nouriſh'd in the womb, there are but few that can teach a right conceiving of Chriſt in the mind and Conſcience. Hence it comes to paſs, that there are ſo many that pertain to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-Law, that wanteth the Heavenly liquor to nouriſh her young, and ſo few that pertain to the true Mother that hath her goblet full. Therefore it comes to paſs, that in ſtead of generating Children unto glory, the glory flyeth away like a Bird, (that is to ſay, the right underſtanding of the Goſpel) <hi>from the Birth,</hi>

                  <p>Therefore all thoſe that are ſpiritual Fathers and Mothers in the Church of God, that would come under the Churches commendation in this place, muſt endeavour to learn the true way of propagating the Goſpel into the Conſcience,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:66021:169"/>that it may be full of Heavenly liquor, where by it may kill the rigour of the Law, and quench the fiery darts of the Devil: then ſhall the Babe be nouriſhed in the womb, otherwiſe <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhall be conceived in ſtead of Chriſt.

                     <hi>to be a great wonder in Heaven,</hi> in that ſhe being with Child cryed travailing in Birth, and pained to be delivered. Now to be in pain, to travail and to cry, is to be under the apprehenſion of ſin and the Law with all its effects: In which hour of tribulation, the Church is in much pain, and cryeth for deliverance, that is, to God for help and ſuccour, and ſticketh to him by faith, perſwading her ſelf that Chriſt hath a fellow feeling of all her miſeries, and is nearly touched with the ſame. When after this manner faith worketh againſt the tribulations which we feel, and our hearts begin to be warmed with the ſame: then is our deliverance come, then do we rejoyce like a woman that is delivered of
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:66021:170"/>her Child, <hi>for joy that a man is born into the world,</hi> that is, <hi>for joy that Chriſt is born in the Conſcience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now her belly is not only big, but is alſo likened to an heap of Wheat, becauſe by the Preaching of the Croſs ſhe bringeth forth Chriſt into the world, who is the bread of life, and giveth life to the world. And is ſet about with Lillies, becauſe all the Lillies of Chriſt do feed upon Chriſt, who is the living bread which came down from Heaven: and alſo upon that living water which floweth out of the <hi>belly of the Spouſe,</hi> according to Chriſts own words, <hi>he that believeth in me,</hi>

Mark we then where the Lillies grow, and where they are cloathed and arrayed, and made ſo glorious, for there is the heap of Wheat, there is the living bread that came down from Heaven, and giveth life unto the World, and alſo the living water, which whoſoever drinketh thereof, ſhall live for ever, and never be more a thirſt.</p>

                  <p>Now in that Faith is like the Throne wherein King <hi>Solomon</hi> ſate to Judg, it ſheweth that a Chriſtian man is in reſpect of his faith,
<note place="margin">Charity hath no place in matters of the firſt Table: but God and his word muſt only be ſtuck unto.</note> a Lord and Judg of all, and ſervant to none.

Therefore, the judgment of faith muſt conclude and determin all things, <hi>(it being the judgment of God, Chriſt, and the holy Ghoſt)</hi> and not a tittle of it muſt be diminiſhed. A man muſt rather ſuffer his life to be taken from him than the glory of God to be loſt. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in a point of faith when the truth of the Goſpel
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:66021:171"/>was brought in Queſtion, would not give place to the falſe brethren, no not for an hour. Therefore no man muſt think,

For this I do <hi>(as there he ſaith)</hi> for the Goſpels ſake. But when the matter in Queſtion is concerning Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Salvation, or Everlaſting Damnation, a man is to be ſo certain of his faith, and the
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:66021:171"/>foundation upon which he buildeth, that he is to give place to none, he is not to be in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection for an hour. Then is the neck under the commendation here, of King <hi>Solomons</hi> Tower, or Throne of Jvory. The next thing commended are the Eyes of the Church.</p>
                  <q>—Thine eyes are like the Fiſh-pools in Heſhbon, by the gates of Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabbim:—</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Heſhbon</hi> was a City where <hi>Sihon</hi> King of the <hi>Amorites</hi> ſometime dwelt. The fiſh-pools in <hi>Heſhbon</hi> were certain ponds where fiſh were wont to breed,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Num.</hi> 21.26.</note> without which fiſh-pools the fry could not be preſerved. <hi>The gates of Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabbim,</hi> were in a certain place <hi>(as is probable)</hi> near unto the Kings fiſh-pools, and alſo the way unto the fiſh-pools: and frequented by many that did deſire to ſee the pools, or to have any taſt of the Kings fiſh. So that if any one did deſire to fiſh there, or to taſt of the fiſh that were bred in thoſe pools: he muſt come in by <hi>the gates of Bethrabbim.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The meaning of the ſimilitude I conceive to be this. The fiſh-pools are the waters of life, the fiſh that are bred in thoſe pools are men, the Fiſhers in thoſe pools are the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel, <hi>called by our Saviour Fiſhers of men: Heſhbon</hi> being a City of the <hi>Amorites,</hi> where the Law was not given, ſignifieth the
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:66021:172"/>free-mother, which is barren in the account of the world, but gendereth many Children unto God. The eyes which are like theſe fiſh-pools, are the eyes of the underſtanding, which being enlightned in the knowledg of the Goſpel, and how to apply it, do breed many a good fiſh. <hi>By the gates of Bethrabbim,</hi> or way to the fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pools, underſtand the new and living way to the waters of life: which being rightly opened, the fiſh-pools are well ſtored with many a good fiſh, but if not, few fiſh ſhall come into the Net, and the fiſh-pools ſhall be but of little uſe.</p>
                  <p>This matter is plainly expreſſed in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eze.</hi> 47.8.9.</note> where the waters of the Sanctuary are ſaid to go down into the deſert, and that every thing that liveth, which moveth, whitherſoever the river ſhall come, ſhall live. And that there ſhall be a very great multitude of fiſh becauſe theſe waters ſhall come thither. From whence it is plain, that ſeeing the waters of the Sanctuary run down into the deſert, that the fiſh-pool is not made in the fruitful, but in the barren and Solitary place; which muſt comfort every poor dejected Soul that is ſenſible of his own barrenneſs, and encourage him to drink of the living water that he may live for ever. For thither the River ſhall run, and there the fiſh ſhall breed, and increaſe to a multitude, by reaſon of the coming of the waters. Let every one then that feeleth his miſery, rejoyce and be glad, and clap his
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:66021:172"/>hands for joy, and not be an enemy to himſelf in ſtopping up the paſſage of the River, and in ſtriving to turn it over the fruitful Land, where it can never run, but let him drink ſweetly of the Heavenly fiſh-pool, then ſhall his eyes be like the fiſh-pools in <hi>Heſhbon,</hi> where the fry ſhall be preſerved, and the ponds ſtored.</p>
                  <p>Alſo this teacheth all thoſe that are fiſhers, that intend to caſt in their Nets, ſo as to catch men, to learn rightly to open the gates of <hi>Bathrabbim,</hi> the new and living way to life; which cannot be done, unleſs they go to Chriſt for the key, who giveth the ſame, to thoſe whom he intendeth ſhall be fiſhers of men. Where thoſe gates are not opened, the way to the fiſh-pools can never be found.</p>
                  <p>Some poure the waters of life into the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Soil only, which is, not only to ſhut them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out of the Kingdom of Heaven, but alſo others. For all their labour is to make men holy by the Law: which is but to leave them under the curſe and condemnation of the Law. Theſe inſtead of preſerving the full fry of fiſh, do dam up the pools, and where there are no fiſh-pools there can be no fiſh, and where there be no fiſh beed, all the labour in making the ponds is utterly loſt. So that for want of a right bait for the fiſh to nibble at, thoſe that in likelyhood might have bred good fiſh, do in the end decay and come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                  <pb n="330" facs="tcp:66021:173"/>
                  <p>And as the way to the fiſh-pools muſt be open'd, ſo the right time muſt be obſerved when to caſt in the Net, which muſt not be until Chriſt calleth: Some run before they are ſent, <hi>theſe fiſh all night with the diſciples, but catch nothing;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.</note> 
                     <hi>but when Chriſt bid them caſt in their Nets, they caught a multitude of fiſh.</hi> When Chriſt committed the uncircumciſion to <hi>Paul,</hi> and the circumciſion to <hi>Peter,</hi> a mighty work was wrought by them: but when men run be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are call'd, all their labour in fiſhing is loſt.</p>
                  <p>Others there are that are able fiſhers, but they forſake their own fiſh-pools, where Chriſt bids them fiſh, and run to other ponds, and caſt in their Nets for another ſort of fiſh: theſe are like <hi>Jonah,</hi> who when God ſent him to <hi>Nineveh,</hi> ran to <hi>Tarſhiſh,</hi> and what followed this? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he refuſed to fiſh where God ſent him, therefore God provided a fiſh at length <hi>to catch him and ſwallow him up.</hi> To conclude all, let all men that are Miniſters in the Church of God, endeavour in the fear of Gods name, to be ſo well enlightned in the knowledg of the Goſpel: that they may rightly perform their Office, then ſhall they be ſee-ers indeed, and come under this commendation in the Text, thine eyes are like the fiſh-pools in <hi>Heſhbon.</hi>

                     <hi>CArmel</hi> was a Mountain whither <hi>Eliah</hi> (by Commandment from the King) <hi>ſent for the falſe Prophets and ſlew them;</hi>

                     <hi>the Prophets of Baal were four Hundred, and the Prophets of the Groves four Hundred and fifty.</hi> And it was to this end and purpoſe, that the people might be convicted concerning the knowledg and worſhip of the true God: where an Altar was to be Built, and Sacrifices provided, but no Fire put under, and the God that anſwered by Fire, was to be acknowledged for the true God, which was anſwered by the conſuming of <hi>Eliahs</hi> Sacrifice. Therefore <hi>Eliah</hi> brought the falſe Prophets down to the brook <hi>Ciſhon</hi> and ſlew them there.</p>
                  <p>Alſo <hi>Carmel</hi> was a place where <hi>Nabal</hi> did inhabite,

<pb n="333" facs="tcp:66021:174"/>the Churches head is likened to <hi>Carmel,</hi> it ſheweth that as ſhe is fruitful in faith and all good works: ſo alſo in conceiving the right way for the overthrowing the Doctrine of all falſe Prophets, which none can do but only the Bride of Chriſt. For although many ſpend much time about controverſies in Religion, yet for want of ſtating the caſe aright, the only matter in difference, <hi>(many times)</hi> never comes in Queſtion, and all the work remains to be done. The head of ſuch is not like unto <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel</hi> the fruitful Mountain: but rather like unto the Mountains of <hi>Gilboa</hi> barren and unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. But herein the Churches head is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, and the way how ſhe attaineth to this Heavenly skill, is ſet down in the next words.</p>
                  <q>—The King is held in the Galleries.</q>
                  <p>Galleries are certain walks that are often builded by Princes, and great men, into which Galleries they uſe to retire themſelves, when then intend to meditate, or diſcourſe about matters of weight. From which cuſtom I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the word Galleries is here borrowed, and the meaning to be this, to ſhew the way that the ſpouſe of Chriſt walketh in inſtating, and handling of controverſies: for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing of falſe opinions which is, She holdeth faſt the King in the Galleries. The meaning is, She alloweth of no contention in the Church,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:66021:175"/>unleſs it be about a matter that concerneth Chriſt her King: If the point in difference ſeem to be ere ſo great,
<note place="margin">The Church avoideth vain jang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings about the Law and her own ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed works.</note> and the contention ever ſo ſharp, yet if it touch not againſt the Goſpel, ſhe medleth not in it: and on the contrary, if it ſeem to be ever ſo ſmall a matter in difference, if it claſheth but in the leaſt title againſt the Goſpel, ſhe then armeth her ſelf by the Goſpel to meet her adverſary in the field.</p>
                  <p>Now herein lyeth the fruitfulneſs of the Churches head in diſcerning this thing, in that ſhe maketh enquiry into the propoſition holden by the contrary party, and the extent of it: whither directly or by conſequent, it daſheth againſt the Kingdom of Chriſt, that ſo ſhe may arm her ſelf accordingly. So that ſhe entereth not in to controverſy unleſs it be to preſerve the Goſpel: neither fighteth ſhe againſt any falſe opinion, with any other weapon, but the Goſpel, and thus ſhe holdeth the King in the Galleries.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Galleries muſt we alſo walk in, when we meddle with controverſies. No jang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling nor quarrelling, <hi>(much leſs ſeperation)</hi> muſt be made about the Law,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.9.</note> 
                     <hi>foraſmuch as every man is faulty in reſpect of his works,</hi> therefore every man muſt bear, ſubmit, and pray for another: and alſo reprove in love and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, thereby to win men <hi>(if poſſible)</hi> to faith in Chriſt: but if any man ſhall hold any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which either directly or by conſequence,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:66021:175"/>daſheth againſt the Goſpel,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Jude</hi> 1.</note> no man muſt bear it, but endeavour by the Goſpel to overthrow it.</p>
                  <p>When the Queſtion is not about fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, let every man keep his faith to himſelf, that no diviſion be made in the Church:
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.</note> haſt thou faith have it to thy ſelf before God, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there will be no end of diſputing in the Church, but if the matter in Queſtion, be any way againſt faith in Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Every man muſt be ſtrong to defend the Goſpel.</note> then muſt every mans mouth be open. This is to hold the King in the Galleries: which Galleries, if they had been walk'd in for Twenty years paſt, we had not ſeen the days which now we have ſeen.</p>
                  <p>The falſe Propheteſs walketh in other Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries in medling with controverſies. She raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth contentions, and many vain janglings, not about faith in Chriſt, but about the Law,
<note place="margin">That is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an opinion of her ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed works, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe priceth ſo high, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are naught.</note> which ſheweth, that ſhe hath no ſmall opinion of her ſelf, but that ſhe prizeth her own ſinful works, far beyond the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, elſe why doth ſhe ſeparate from Church aſſemblies, accounting all men to be Anti-chriſtian, if they be wanting <hi>(only)</hi> in the works of the Law? There is a mixed multitude, the Miniſter is not rightly called, and many other things are done, or not done which <hi>(as ſhe ſuppoſeth)</hi> are beſides the rule, but what of all this? Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things were ever wanting in men, and ever will be, ſo long as the Church is on this ſide perfection.</p>
                  <pb n="336" facs="tcp:66021:176"/>
                  <p>Now becauſe ſhe forſaketh the Church only for her blemiſhes, not becauſe faith is not Preached, but in that works are wanting: therefore ſhe holdeth not the King in the Galleries, but preferreth <hi>Moſes</hi> before Chriſt. And what follows all, but only this becauſe ſhe prizeth the ſinful works of men, far beyond the gifts of God, and righteouſneſs of Chriſt: therefore ſhe condemneth the Goſpel, and is condemned by the Goſpel. According to the ſaying of our Saviour, he that believeth not is condemned already.</p>
                  <p>This way muſt we alſo walk in, in pacifying and quieting the afflicted Conſciences, even to hold the King in the Galleries: For if when the Conſcience is in diſtreſs, the Law be then acknowledged to be the Lord, then ſhall it be ſhut up faſt in priſon and bondage, then ſhall it be held under the Law, whereby it is accuſed and condemned, this is to hold <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Galleries, not the King.</p>
                  <p>Therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> the ſervant, muſt be caſt out of the afflicted Conſcience, by faith in Chriſt: and not ſuffered to lodge in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber with his Lord. Let us learn therefore to behold by faith, <hi>Moſes</hi> with his Sepulchre to be vaniſh'd away in reſpect of the Conſcience: that Chriſt with his Righteouſneſs may rule and reign. Thus muſt we hold faſt Chriſt our King: againſt all Enemies without and within.</p>
                  <pb n="337" facs="tcp:66021:176"/>
                  <p>Now in that the Churches hair is commended, it meaneth believers, <hi>(as is ſhewed elſewhere)</hi> and by purple their clothing, ſhewing that all thoſe that are fruitful in this Divine and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Art, are clothed in purple, <hi>(even with the Righteouſneſs of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt)</hi> which is a Princely Robe. For they are thoſe that do overcome by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of his Teſtimony.</p>

                  <p>CHriſt having before commended his ſpouſe in reſpect of the parts and features of the body, under divers and ſundry ſimilitudes: here he ſetteth forth her full growth under the ſimilitude of the <hi>Palm-tree,</hi> concerning which Tree there are divers things written by Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</p>
                  <p>As firſt, that they grow in Couples, Male and Female, and are full of ſeed, but the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male is only fruitful, yet not except growing by the Male. And alſo, that it is of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that although never ſo huge and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous a waight be put upon it, yet never to yield to the burden, but ſtill to reſiſt the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs thereof: and to endeavour the more to lift and raiſe it ſelf upward.</p>
                  <p>Now the Stature of the Bride being likened to the <hi>Palm-tree,</hi> it ſheweth what the nature of faith is in all the godly; even to lift it ſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, in the midd'ſt of the greateſt fears and perplexities, and notwithſtanding all burdens and waights yet ſtill to grow through them all. Therefore in <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.9. Thoſe that had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the victory over <hi>Satan</hi> and the world by
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:66021:177"/>faith in Chriſt; appeared in <hi>white Robes and Palm-branches in their hands, as tokens of joy and victory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this is alſo promiſed in the <hi>Pſalms,</hi>

                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.12.</note> 
                     <hi>that the Righteous ſhall flouriſh like a Palm-tree.</hi> There is no doubt but every Chriſtian ſhall be put to the tryal, by having a heavy weight layed upon him at ſome time or other in his life: which weight according to the fleſh and reaſon, ſhall ſeem to preſs him down to the very ground, ſo that in appearance he ſhall never be able to grow upright again. Therefore we find, that in the deſcription of the Temple, there were round about the Houſe figures of <hi>Cherubims</hi> and <hi>Palm-trees,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eze.</hi> 41.18.</note> where a <hi>Palm-tree</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a <hi>Cherub</hi> and a <hi>Cherub:</hi> and every <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubim</hi> had two faces, the face of a man, and the face of a Lion, the face of a man was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Palm-tree</hi> on the one ſide, and the face of a Lion towards the <hi>Palm-tree</hi> on the other ſide.</p>
                  <p>This face of a Lion is doubtleſs <hi>Satan,</hi> who hath his face always towards the <hi>Palm-tree,</hi> uſing all means to cruſh it down, by caſting heavy weights and burdens upon it: but the face of a man, is the loving countenance of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt clothed in our humanity, which always looks upon us to comfort and ſtrengthen us, againſt all the aſſaults and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the Devil.</p>
                  <pb n="340" facs="tcp:66021:178"/>
                  <p>Therefore in ſuch conditions we muſt live by faith, and pray without ceaſing, for as it is ſure and certain that the face of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, is towards us upon the one ſide, by whoſe loving countenance we ſhall be ſure of the Victory.</p>
                  <p>So is it alſo as certain, that the face of the Lion is upon us on the other ſide, even <hi>Satan</hi> the roaring Lion that waiteth continually to devour us.</p>
                  <p>Therefore muſt we continually watch and pray, and look unto Chriſt by faith, for <hi>(as was ſaid before)</hi> the <hi>Palm-tree</hi> groweth not to be fruitful except it grow by the Male: therefore let us hold faſt our head and Husband the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that we may be fruitful to Eternal life.</p>
                  <p>Then ſhall the breaſts of conſolation be full, <hi>like cluſters,</hi> which when we have the true uſe thereof, ſhall wonderfully comfort and ſtrengthen us, againſt all the heavy weights and burdens that <hi>Satan</hi> ſhall caſt upon us.</p>

                        <hi>I ſaid, I will go up to the Palm-tree, I will take hold of the boughs thereof: now alſo thy breaſts ſhall be as cluſters of the Vine, and the ſmell of thy Noſe like Apples.</hi>

                  <p>THe <hi>Palm-tree</hi> as was ſaid before, is the Church, and the boughs are the Children of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Now here it is ſhewed how they grow to be ſo fruitful, it is becauſe Chriſt taketh hold firſt, therefore the breaſts are full of the Wine of conſolation, and the noſe ſmelleth variety of fruit in the word of God. The ſum of theſe words is this.</p>
                  <p>That the principal means for the Children of the Church to be fill'd with variety of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent fruits, is to ſuffer the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to take hold of them firſt. To ſuffer him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin and to perfect his own work, by his own means, and in his own way.</p>
                  <p>And the reaſon is, becauſe God hath decreed that all men that ſhall ever be made holy and fruitful, ſhall have it his way. Therefore Chriſt ſays here, <hi>I ſaid, I will take hold, and my word ſhall ſtand.</hi> Therefore the <hi>Palm-tree</hi> and all his branches ſhall be made fruitful his way, or not at all.</p>
                  <pb n="342" facs="tcp:66021:179"/>
                  <p>Which ſheweth us the reaſon, why there is ſo much unfruitfulneſs amongſt the Children of the Church, why men remain ſo blind in their underſtandings, ſo perverſe in their wills and affections, and grow to ſo little ſtature in Chriſtianity: the reaſon is, becauſe they will not ſuffer the Lord Chriſt Jeſus to begin with them firſt, to take hold and begin his own work in his own way. Nothing will ſerve the turn, unleſs they themſelves begin firſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they can bring ſomething of their own whereby to deſerve his favour.</p>
                  <p>Hence it comes to paſs, that in ſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fill'd with Cluſters of the Vine which yield the Wine of Conſolation, and of ſcenting that variety of fruit, which groweth in the Orchard of the Lord: they bring forth ſoure grapes, wild fruits, ſuch as are fit for nothing but to be caſt away.</p>
                  <p>From this ground alſo it comes to paſs, that ſo many forſake the Church of God, and run ſome to one Sect, and ſome to another until they have quite loſt themſelves and run to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; the reaſon is becauſe they will not ſuffer Chriſt to begin, but they themſelves muſt take hold firſt: therefore they forſake the way where he begins, the dore by which he enters, the gate by which he openeth Everlaſting life to Men; and every man chooſeth, his own way, his own work, his own rule, hoping thereby to pleaſe God, ſo as to receive ſomething from him as large as life Eternal.</p>
                  <pb n="343" facs="tcp:66021:179"/>
                  <p>And from hence alſo proceeds another evil, which is, that when great croſſes and tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations come, which is the way by which God doth uſe to govern his Church: no man will give him ſo much honour as to confeſs that it is the Lord that taketh hold upon him, but inſtead thereof we fall to quarrelling, and contending, with ſecond cauſes, with thoſe inſtruments by which God doth afflict us and govern us; and in ſo doing we quarrel and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend againſt the Lord.</p>
                  <p>So that when God provides the croſs on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to humble us and drive us into the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerciſe of our faith, that we might learn ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally to know him to be our God, in creating ways and means for our deliverance, which we never underſtood: we will by no means ſuffer him to begin with us, or lay hold on us, we humble not our ſelves before him, ſeek not, nor ſubmit unto him, but rather ſeek how to revenge our ſelves upon him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is juſt with the Lord <hi>(ſeeing we will not ſuffer him to take hold upon us, to enter within us, and open Everlaſting life unto us)</hi> that when death, judgment, the Law, Conſcience, the Devil, and Hell, do begin to ſtare in our faces, that we ſhould be forſaken of him and left, in a moſt deſperate and ſad condition.</p>
                  <p>Therefore let us ſuffer Chriſt to go up to the <hi>Palm-tree and take hold of the boughs thereof:</hi> which he firſt doth viſibly, when we are Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:66021:180"/>in his name. Secondly, inviſibly, when he giveth us the Holy Ghoſt, who teacheth us to underſtand our Baptiſm: which leadeth us to ſubmit to the condemnation of the Law, which is juſtly due unto us, and to fly to Chriſt by faith, and walk in newneſs of Spirit. But if we put a falſe conſtruction upon our Baptiſm, and think that Chriſt doth not begin with us, and own us thereby: we then ſuffer him not to take hold on the boughs, but forſake the viſible foundation of our faith.</p>
                  <p>Baptiſm is like the Pillar of Stone, between <hi>Laban</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> which was a witneſs between them, that neither of them muſt paſs beyond that pillar towards the other for hurt.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it witneſſeth unto us, that God beareth us no grudg, which witneſs he cannot deny, if we ſtick unto it by faith: then ſhall we love, fear, and obey him, and flouriſh like the <hi>Palm-tree;</hi> but if we forſake his witneſs, and break Covenant with him, then will God be conſtrained to enter into judgment with us, then ſhall we never feel the comfort of the breaſt, the wine of conſolation, neither ſhall our noſe ever ſmell that variety of excellent fruit, which otherwiſe we might have found in the word of God.</p>

                  <p>This is that which Chriſt ſaith, <hi>goeth down ſweetly,</hi> and that it is for his beloved: it is not for ſtrangers to taſt of, but the family of God, that are willing to hear and underſtand the way to the Tree of life.</p>

                  <p>This is the firſt uſe of the palate. And the next is, it is the inſtrument of ſpeech, which cauſeth an utterance of things Divine.

                  <p>IN which words are ſet down the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the Bride maketh from the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of her beloved mentioned before. Which concluſion is this. <hi>I am my beloveds.</hi> And the cauſe of her yielding her ſelf thus unto him is, from the confidence ſhe hath of his affection to her, which is ſet down in the words next following, <hi>his deſire is towards me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But how commeth the Church to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, by the word of God, for being Baptized in his name, and in learning the uſe of her Baptiſm: She perceiveth by faith that her perſon is accepted, and this confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence muſt we all learn to have in Chriſt, even that his deſire is to us, and his heart upon us.</p>
                  <p>Now this is a wonderful thing, that the deſire of the ſon of God, ſhould be after a poor miſerable ſinner that is his Enemy: yet this is the truth ſhe here believeth, and it is alſo written for us that we might believe.</p>
                  <pb n="348" facs="tcp:66021:182"/>
                  <p>For mark it,
<note place="margin">The Church perceiving Chriſt to peep after her who is deſpiſed in her own eyes: and commend her ſo much, yieldeth her ſelf wholy unto him, and ſo the match is made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and the Soul.</note> in all the foregoing Verſes in this Chapter, Chriſt ſetteth forth the beauty of her perſon, by which ſhe findeth his deſire is after her: for which very reaſon ſhe yieldeth her ſelf to him and ſays, <hi>I am my beloveds,</hi> and ſo the match is made. From all which we ſee this clear.</p>
                  <p>That the main matter, which makes up the match, and knits the knot, <hi>between Chriſt and the Soul:</hi> is when we find by the word of God that Chriſt is willing to take us with nothing, and that we are willing to caſt our ſelves upon him on the ſame terms.</p>
                  <p>And the reaſon is, becauſe nothing elſe is required in our Marriage with Chriſt, but a conſent of both parties: which conſent there is not until we agree upon terms.</p>
                  <p>Which informeth us in the Reaſon, why there are ſo few that are married to Chriſt, and ſo many to Antichriſt, the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they agree not upon terms. Chriſt uſeth all art and skill, that is poſſible for a lover to uſe, to draw people to himſelf: and bringeth the matter ſo near to ones view, that a man would imagine the contract were made, yet let the caſe be but rightly ſtated, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions on both ſides rightly look'd into: and a man ſhall find as much difference in the terms, as there is between light and darkneſs. The terms upon Chriſts ſide being to take us with nothing, or not at all: but the terms on
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:66021:182"/>the other ſide, are to bring a ſufficient portion, or elſe not to marry as yet. This is a deſpiſing to marry with Chriſt who is raiſed from the dead to deliver us from our ſins: and to live in Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity under our firſt husband the Law, and to die for ever in our ſins.</p>
                  <p>We muſt therefore learn, to ſubmit our ſelves to Chriſt and to yield to his own terms. Chriſt will not be brought to our terms. Our terms are to bring a portion with us, but Chriſt ſays all that we have is worth nothing: which difference is very great.</p>
                  <p>Therefore he requireth nothing of us, but that we ſtedfaſtly believe and confeſs this one thing, that although we are condemned by the Law, being poor miſerable and wretched Sinners: yet that his deſire is towards us. Therefore muſt we learn to confeſs our ſins before him with confidence that he will forgive us; and with the Bride to believe, that his deſire is towards me, that he came down from Heaven for me, and ſatisfied the wrath of God for me.</p>
                  <p>Thus muſt we with the Bride, firſt endeavour to find, that we are objects of Chriſts deſire, and next of all, to confeſs, by our conſenting to his choiſe, that we are his: then ſhall we not only attain, to true Righteouſneſs and bleſſedneſs but alſo to an aſſurance of the ſame.</p>

                  <p>And by Villages ſhe meaneth, ſuch as where Chriſt and his Apoſtles <hi>went up and down Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel.</hi> By which we ſee, that the Churches care is not only to receive the Goſpel, but alſo to plant the Goſpel, and this ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do without her beloved; therefore ſhe
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:66021:183"/>taketh Chriſt with her. Thoſe that go forth into the Vineyard without the Beloved may compel men to labour and toil, to bear the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and heat of the day: but they can never gather a ſheaf into Gods barn.</p>
                  <p>And this muſt be the care of every one in his place, to go forth with Chriſt into the Fields, and help to ſet forwards the Husbandry of God, that a good foundation may be laid for harveſt: to lodge his Doctrine in the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, that ſo the ſeeds of Eternal life being ſown in the minds of men, there may be hopes of a joyful crop.</p>
                  <p>There muſt not be only plowing in Gods field, but alſo ſowing. For how can any man expect a crop at harveſt, if he ſhall only Plow, and break the clods, and make plain the face of the Earth, if he never ſow the ſeed? Now the ſower is the ſon of man, not <hi>Moſes,</hi> but Chriſt. Which ploweth up the fallow ground of the heart by the condemning power of the Law: and then it ſoweth the immortal ſeed of the word into the diſtreſſed mind.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moſes</hi> neither ſoweth the ſeed,
<note place="margin">Moſes <hi>ſaith do it and live, but break it and die: which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nor ſoweth: therefore without Chriſt</hi> Moſes <hi>is a deſtroyer: becauſe the promiſe being made to doing, all men naturally think to obtain it that way; But Chriſt ſaith thou haſt ſinned and art deprived of the glory of God: and calleth us to believe the ſame, and to fly to himſelf by faith and confeſſion.</hi>
                     </note> nor yet plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up the fallow ground: but only command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it to grow, and if it proſper, promiſeth a goodly Harveſt. Thoſe that pertain to the Kingdom of <hi>Moſes,</hi> do require the works of the Law to be done; and then promiſe Eternal life to the doers, but touch it not with the leaſt of their fingers. Theſe plant nothing in
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:66021:184"/>Gods field but (<hi>only that which which was there before they nouriſh</hi>) an opinion of themſelves; which nothing changeth the nature of the ground, which is a moſt miſerable evil, and marreth all good Husbandry in the Church of God.</p>
                  <p>Therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> without a Mediator ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not, but only to bridle the outward man and to keep it in fear: but in the hand of a Mediator, that is to ſay Chriſt, is of rare an Excellent uſe, Firſt to reveal ſin to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience that it may be driven to Chriſt: next it openeth a light unto us to teach us how to ſerve in newneſs of Spirit, and not in the oldneſs of the Letter.</p>

                     <hi>the Conſcience made tender by the word of God.</hi> And by the budding of the <hi>Pomegranate,</hi> the growth of the Church in Heavenly Doctrine, and in ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth all good works before men. And in that ſhe ſays, <hi>let us go up early to the Vineyards,</hi> it meaneth before falſe Teachers creep in and ſpoil the fruit. For as ſoon as the Fox cometh he falleth upon the Vine, he endeavoureth to ſpoil Chriſt of his name and glory.</p>
                  <p>Therefore to prevent this, ſhe ſaith, <hi>let us get up to the Vineyards,</hi> meaning the principal members in the Church, both in the Magiſtracy and Miniſtry: whoſe care ought to be, that the Church be rightly inſtructed in ſound Doctrine, and that order be taken with thoſe
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:66021:185"/>that are perverters of the Goſpel. There ſhe ſaith, <hi>I will give thee my loves,</hi> that is, in ſo doing, I will teſtify my loves unto thee; meaning to Chriſt: She ſpeaketh in the plural number, becauſe it is more then a bare ſingle love, it being not only to Chriſt, but alſo to his Members. The ſum of all is this.</p>
                  <p>That it is a very great Teſtimony of love to God, and a principal means in cauſing the Lords Vineyard to become fruitful, when an early care is taken, by the principal Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in the Church; that the word be purely taught, and that the mouths of falſe Teachers be ſtopped.</p>
                  <p>If the word be not rightly taught, no man's Conſcience can be edified: if the mouths of ſeducers be not ſhut <hi>Satan</hi> will quickly pervert the Goſpel of Chriſt. Either of theſe wants hindereth the fruitſulneſs of the Vineyard; and in a manner layeth it waſt. Such therefore muſt be charged by <hi>Timothy,</hi> that they Preach no other Doctrine: or elſe by <hi>Titus</hi> their mouths muſt be ſtopped.</p>
                  <p>Want of care in this thing betimes, ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the flouriſhing of the Vine, <hi>the budding of the Pomegranate:</hi> neither doth the tender grape hardly every appear.</p>
                  <p>Care therefore muſt be taken in this, that no perſon be ſuffered in the <hi>Vineyard,</hi> that is a Seducer: nor ſet to work in the <hi>Vineyard,</hi>
                     <pb n="355" facs="tcp:66021:185"/>unleſs <hi>he be a cunning Artificer,</hi> a man of skill, that is able to ſuccour the tender grape, and to refreſh the <hi>Pomegranate,</hi> that his buds may ſhoot forth and appear.</p>
                  <p>This is a work highly acceptable to the Father, who is the great Husbandman, and to the ſon who is the Archbiſhop of his Church; and therefore I humble conceive it ought to be the care of every Biſhop.</p>
                  <p>If any man offend in his life, the Magiſtrate is to puniſh him, but if any man go about to pervert the Goſpel: <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> muſt go up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> about the Queſtion, where ſhould always be ſome that are able to hear and determin the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Whatſoever care is taken, or ought to be taken, about matters of Diſcipline, yet, it is moſt certain, that the main, and principal thing to be cared for, and looked after, is matter of Doctrine: that mens Conſciences be rightly inſtructed, otherwiſe no man can be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>What miſery is come upon us, for many years paſt, for want of this care, we have ſeen by woful experience.</p>

                  <p>THeſe are the words of Chriſt, which are of the nature of a promiſe to ſupply his Church with the variety of all pleaſant fruits.</p>
                  <p>And firſt of all, he ſpeaketh of the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>Mandrakes,</hi> of which we read in <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.14. which were found by <hi>Reuben</hi> in the time of Wheat Harveſt.</p>
                  <p>All that I gather from it is this. <hi>Reuben</hi> was the firſt born ſon of <hi>Jacob:</hi> which firſt born ſon was a type of Chriſt, the firſt born among many brethren.</p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>Mandrakes</hi> being brought by <hi>Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben</hi> to his Mother <hi>Leah, (which were very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful as it appears by Rachel)</hi> it ſheweth unto us the Excellency of the fruits that come to us by Chriſt who is the firſt begotten of the dead: which are the fruits of his Death and Reſurrection, manifeſted by the Preaching of the Goſpel. Which are ſaid to be pleaſant
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:66021:186"/>Fruits, meaning to the tender afflicted Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
                  <p>The time when they appear ſo pleaſant is, when the gates are opened: when the Goſpel of Eternal life is opened and rightly applyed to the tender Conſcience. Theſe Fruits are ſaid to be <hi>New and Old,</hi> not in reſpect of ſubſtance of Doctrine, but the variety.</p>
                  <p>And it being ſaid,
<note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                     <hi>which I have laid up for thee my beloved,</hi> it ſheweth, that all the ſecret Miſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, that have been hid from ages: are laid up on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe by Chriſt himſelf, to beſtow upon thoſe that put an high eſtimation upon them. And this I conceive to be the meaning of the words.</p>
                  <p>And the Reaſon why they are laid up only for ſuch is, becauſe the Miſteries of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven are of an Infinit value, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt not be beſtowed upon thoſe that will deſpiſe them: they are of ſo great a price that no man is able to put an eſtimate upon them, they are beyond Silver, Gold, and Rubies, and all things that can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired.</p>
                  <p>Now who can imagine that Jewels of ſuch ineſtimable worth,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.15.</note> ſhall be given to ſuch that ſhall only Trample them under ther Feet? Therefore Chriſt hath laid them up <hi>for his beloved:</hi> Even for thoſe that eſteem of them moſt highly, above their appointed food.</p>
                  <pb n="358" facs="tcp:66021:187"/>
                  <p>Which openeth the cauſe, and ſheweth us the Reaſon, why there are ſo few that are acquainted with the ſecrets of the word of God, that underſtand ſo little of the Miſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, it is not becauſe Chriſt is not willing to open the Secrets, and reveal the Miſteries, but the reaſon is, becauſe men put no eſtimation upon them.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt hath laid up all manner of pleaſant Fruits, hath abundance in ſtore to beſtow, of things both <hi>New and Old,</hi> upon all thoſe that are willing to receive them: but no man cares for the taſte of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Mandrakes give a moſt Excellent ſmell:</hi> but no man careth for the ſcent. At wiſdoms gates <hi>are all manner of pleaſants Fruits,</hi> even thoſe that heal the Nations, that ſave us from the Everlaſting wrath of God: but we value them not, we look not after them, but ſet an higher eſtimation upon Tranſitory things that periſh, then upon thoſe Everlaſting things, that ſhall never decay.</p>
                  <p>Juſt like unto Children, that more eſteem of a Counter of little or no value at all; than of a rich Jewel that is of great price.</p>
                  <p>Therefore no man muſt blame the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but only himſelf, if he ſhould one day ſee, many to come from the Eaſt and Weſt, and ſit down with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> in the Kingdom of the Father; and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be thruſt out.</p>
                  <pb n="359" facs="tcp:66021:187"/>
                  <p>If he ſhould at the laſt day, for deſpiſing of the Goſpel, be ſeparated from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord <hi>(in whoſe preſence there is fulneſs of joy)</hi> and ſhould be driven to ſuffer the puniſhment of loſs, and the puniſhment of ſenſe for ever: yet I ſay, no man can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, or once open his mouth againſt the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is willing to beſtow all bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings upon men, but they do not value them, nor eſteem them.</p>
                  <p>All men will put a muſt, and neceſſity upon themſelves in other matters, to riſe early, and to go to bed late, and to eat the bread of carefulneſs: but ſcarce any man counts it a neceſſity to attend at the gates of wiſdom, to ſeek after knowledg, to call and cry for under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, without which every man muſt periſh for evermore.</p>
                  <p>Learn we then <hi>(before it be too late)</hi> to put an high price upon the things of the Goſpel, then ſhall the Myſtery be opened to us, which is lock'd up and hid from the wicked deſpiſers thereof. Which thing we can never do, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we feel our need of the Goſpel, and the Infinit worth that there is in it to ſerve our neceſſities.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore learn to behold, the evil ſcent that our ſins do caſt into the noſtrils of God, that we may be afflicted with the ſame: next, we muſt ſmell to the <hi>Mandrakes,</hi> which

                  <p>Therefore when thou art afflicted for thy ſin, and comeſt before God, thou muſt learn to believe in Chriſt, without and againſt the Law: and fully to perſwade thy ſelf, that the Goſpel is thine becauſe thou art without an opinion of the Law.</p>

                  <p>THeſe are the continued words of Chriſt, and ſo to the eight Verſe. And it is a Note of admiration at the ſpouſe, in that ſhe leaneth upon Chriſt by faith in all the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations that ſhe meeteth with, in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this world: by which faith ſhe alſo cometh out of them all.</p>
                  <p>She is not commended, nor admired at, for her Riches, Honour, Proſperity, and eſteem amongſt men: For in the wilderneſs ſhe is commonly without all theſe things, being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with Poverty, Reproach, and all manner of Calamities. Counted as an object, and as the off-ſcowring of all things.</p>
                  <p>Yet in that ſhe doth not faint and pine away in this Condition, but humbleth and ſubmitteth her ſelf to the croſs, <hi>and leaneth upon her beloved through faith,</hi> ſhe is look't up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with a Note of admiration. <hi>Who is this?</hi> We ſee this then clear.</p>
                  <p>That at the ſelf ſame time, that the Church is look't upon as an object of reproach, and of no eſteeem by men of the World; ſhe is
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:66021:193"/>look't upon with admiration by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>In that ſhe is in the Wilderneſs, where ſhe is afflicted: being without the glory of the World, ſhe is deſpiſed of men, but in that ſhe is not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at her condition, but leaneth upon her beloved by Faith, ſhe is look't upon with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. And the reaſon why ſhe is ſo much admired is, becauſe ſhe fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with the word of God, againſt all enimies at once: ſhe ſetteth the Goſpel againſt all oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; therefore <hi>Chriſt ſays here, Who is this?</hi> She hath not only Enemies without, but alſo within, ſhe hath the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, yet with one weapon ſhe over-comes them all, and that is Faith in her beloved.</p>
                  <p>Which conſideration muſt wonderfully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort all thoſe poor wretches, which are much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by men, that are deſpiſed and rejected of the World: who by reaſon of their blemiſhes and ſtaines, or poverty, or any outward calamity, (which things are common in the Wilderneſs) are deſpiſed and reproached, and even utterly rejected of the World; yet, (in that they are willing to ſubmit unto the Croſs without being offended: to humble themſelves and cleave to Chriſt by Faith) their comfort lies in this, that at the very ſame time that they are deſpiſed of men, they are look't upon with admiration by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Which muſt encourage every man to ſubmit himſelf to his Heavenly Father,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:66021:193"/>if he pleaſe to exerciſe him in ſuch a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>This courſe muſt we alſo take, when the Conſcience accuſeth us, the Law threatneth, and we can apprehend nothing but death Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: even then muſt we fall down before him confeſſing our ſins, and hearken to the words of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who at the very ſelf ſame time that we humble our ſelves before him, doth ſpeak good and comfortable words unto us, on purpoſe to draw us to himſelf; therefore muſt we hearken to him and believe his words, then ſhall we not only feed upon the hid <hi>Manna,</hi> that will comfort us in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs: but alſo joyfully ſhall come forth of the <hi>wilderneſs leaning upon our beloved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>—I raiſed thee up under the apple-tree: there thy Mother brought thee forth, there ſhe brought thee forth that bare thee.</q>
                  <p>Theſe words ſhew how this faith and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance was wrought in the Church. <hi>I raiſed thee up under the Apple-tree.</hi> By the Apple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree is meant Chriſt himſelf.

                  <pb n="372" facs="tcp:66021:194"/>
                  <p>And alſo that the fruits of Chriſts death and reſurrection, do naturally and freely drop upon all thoſe that are willing to ſit under the Tree and receive them. By the Mother is here meant the Church, and by her bringing forth, regeneration, which new birth <hi>is under the Apple-tree: for there ſhe brought thee forth that bare thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now in that he ſays, <hi>I raiſed thee up,</hi> he diſtinguiſheth himſelf from <hi>Moſes</hi> or the Law; not but that Chriſt maketh uſe of the Law in the raiſing up of the Church, but in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent reſpect to thoſe that do not rightly teach the Law.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt maketh uſe of the Law to humble the ſinner, that it may be driven to Chriſt by faith, to be juſtified without the Law: but the Miniſtry of <hi>Moſes,</hi> promiſeth, juſtification and life to none but thoſe that turn from ſin Morally according to the the Terms of the Law: and herein lies the difference between the true and the falſe handling of the Law, and by this mark only, may we diſcern the voice of Chriſt, from the voice of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Moſes</hi> caſteth all men down, but raiſeth up no man by his Miniſtry, becauſe he ſetteth them not under the Heavenly Apple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, but endeavoureth to raiſe them firſt by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fruit: therefore he maketh the heart of the righteous ſad, whom the Lord hath not made ſad.</p>
                  <pb n="373" facs="tcp:66021:194"/>
                  <p>But Chriſt caſteth down all men by the Law, but raiſeth them up again by his own fruits: even the fruits of the Heavenly Apple-tree. And after this manner doth the true Mother exerciſe all her Children by the Miniſtry.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, ſhe caſteth them down by a right adminiſtration of <hi>Moſes:</hi> next ſhe raiſeth them up again by Chriſt her Heavenly Apple-tree.</p>
                  <p>Thus muſt we alſo ſuffer our ſelves, to be hewen down by the Law, that we may be ſtripped of all our glory and boaſting prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: and alſo be willing to receive the fruit that droppeth from Chriſt our Heavenly Apple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, that our Conſciences may be healed of the guilt and filth of all our ſins.</p>

So grievous a thing is unbelief, that where it is lodged: it burneth up and conſumeth, all true opinions of God, and of his Holy Word.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, ſeeing our loving Lord Jeſus Chriſt out of his wonderful care and love to us, to ſtrengthen us in our faith, and to preſerve us from this dreadful and bitter Temptation: ſays here, <hi>ſet me as a ſeal upon thine heart,</hi> let us ſuffer the Goſpel to make an impreſſion within us; and look upon it as the decree of Heaven that can never be changed.

                  <p>THeſe are the words of the Church wherein ſhe bemoaneth her little Siſter, when the day comes that ſhe is even ready for mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: <hi>what ſhall we do for her in the day when ſhe ſhall be ſpoken for?</hi> We are not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by the little Siſter, only the Gentiles, (as the moſt do,) which then (when <hi>Solomon</hi> wrote this Book) were without the word: for then how ſhall it be underſtood now ſeeing the Gentiles are called? Therefore ſeeing this bemoaning of the little Siſter is the voice of the Church in all ages: ſuch a ſenſe muſt be found as will agree to all times. Underſtand then by the little Siſter, all thoſe that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned in the Doctrine of the Goſpel, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:66021:197"/>they be <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> within the Pale of the Church, or without: all that belong to the Election of grace, and are yet uncall'd. All theſe are comprehended under the Title of the little Siſter, which firſt or laſt, ſhall be ſpoken for. Little ſhe is, not in number, but in regard of knowledg of the way to Life and Salvation.</p>
                  <p>A Siſter ſhe is, yet not of whole blood, ſhe is Siſter by the Father, but not by the Mother. For as <hi>Abraham</hi> had two Sons, which were brethren by the Father, but not by the Mother: So hath God Almighty two ſorts of people in the world (and but two) which are brethren by generation, but not by regener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They are brethern by the Father, as proceeding all from <hi>Adam:</hi> but not brethren by the Mother, being not yet new born in the Church.</p>
                  <p>And therefore ſhe ſays, ſhe hath yet no breaſts, that is, ſhe hath not breaſts of the true Mother, being not yet born. This little Siſter ſhe bewaileth and bemoaneth, not ſo much for the time preſent, as ſhe doth in thinking on the day when ſhe ſhall be ſpoken for. What ſhall we do for our little Siſter in that day? Which bemoaning is always among the Godly in the Church, and will be to the end of the world. What ſhall I do for my Husband, my Wife, my Son, my Daughter, my Friend?</p>
                  <pb n="380" facs="tcp:66021:198"/>
                  <p>But what is meant here by the day when ſhe ſhall be ſpoken for?

                     </label> the ſpouſeman is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, and the day when the <hi>little Siſter is ſpoken for,</hi> is when ſhe feeleth her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation by the Law. They and all they, that feel their condemnation by the Law: they and all they are ſpoken for by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Now ſhe bemoaneth her little Siſter in this condition, what ſhall we do for her that ſhe may be married to Chriſt? And in that ſhe doth ſo bewail her, and make it her principal care to help her: it giveth us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this.</p>
                  <p>That the principal care of the true Church of God for her little Siſter is, that as ſoon as ſhe perceiveth her to be ſpoken for, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Law: to make dilligent enquiry, how to give her in marriage to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And the Reaſon is firſt, becauſe to Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize the Marriage between Chriſt and the Soul, is a work of the greateſt difficulty that ever was, therefore the Church may well ſay, what ſhall we do for our little Siſter in that day? And alſo it is the moſt deſtructive to <hi>Satans</hi> Kingdom of all things, and therefore the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is moſt ſtrongly oppoſed by the Devil and his Angels. But chiefly becauſe, unleſs the Soul be married to Chriſt, the compound between the Conſcience and the Law can never
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:66021:198"/>be diſſolved or untied: but the ſame bargain or Covenant, that was made with man at firſt remains in force, which bindeth all men to the penalty, which is to endure the wrath of God for ever.</p>
                  <p>This informeth us, that there are but a very few that pertain to the true Church of God, becauſe there are ſo few that make it their principal care, to comfort their little Siſter in the day of her diſtreſs. When ſhe is afflicted with her ſin, and feeleth her condemnation by the Law, and is much broken and diſtreſſed by reaſon of great tribulations, and by theſe things is ſpoken for by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that ſhe might be matched to himſelf: inſtead of making it the principal care, to give her in Marriage to the Son of God by faith alone, they endeavour with great earneſtneſs to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent her to Chriſt by the works of the Law. Inſtead of diſſolving the compound, and making void the Covenant, that was made with man at firſt, and matching the Soul to Chriſt in an Everlaſting Covenant: that the guilt of her ſin might be removed, and that ſhe might be juſtified in the ſight of God, they endeavour in the firſt place <hi>(as the only thing needful)</hi> to Solemnize the contract between her Conſcience and the Law. Which is according to St.
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.</note> 
                     <hi>Pauls</hi> Allegory, but to preſent her an Adultreſs before God, for which ſin, ſeeing ſhe is ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated thereby from the true God: ſhe is bound
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:66021:199"/>in captivity under the guilt of ſin, and is in bondage to <hi>Satan</hi> and the wrath of God for evermore.</p>
                  <p>All people therefore muſt learn from hence to imitate the true Church of God; which is to lay down the true grounds of conſolation for their little Siſter to reſt on in the day of her diſtreſs, that as ſoon as ſhe is ſpoken for and feeleth her condemnation by the Law, and that ſhe hath no breaſts of her own to nouriſh her in her miſery; then to become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental to marry her to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt by faith alone.</p>
                  <p>Now that the match may be made, and that ſhe may be wedded to the Son of God, ſhe muſt acknowledg her death by the Law, and aske forgiveneſs for her ſins with a believing heart,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.</note> then is ſhe free (according to St. <hi>Paul</hi>) from her firſt Husband the Law, being dead unto it through faith in the Son of God. For in that ſhe feeleth and confeſſeth her death by the Law: the Law is alſo become dead, having loſt its power and dominion. Then may are aſſure her, that the compound <hi>(made with man at firſt)</hi> is diſſolved, between the Conſcience and the Law: and may alſo Solemnize the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract between Chriſt and the Soul.</p>
                  <p>This is the duty we muſt all learn, for the helping and comforting of our little Siſter, that ſhe being ſo ſetled in the love of her Redeemer ſhe may burſt forth into love and all good works
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:66021:199"/>amongſt men. To teach this point aright, hath hath ſome difficulty in it, as appears by the moan ſhe makes, what ſhall we do for her in that day, which ſheweth, it requireth ſome skill: yet this was her practice and endeavour, as appeareth in the next words.</p>
